71.300000	79.100000	PRESENTER	My **guest**^[khách mời] on the show today is Alice Riches who **started**^[khởi xướng] the **Street Play Scheme**^[chương trình vui chơi trên đường phố (scheme = kế hoạch / chương trình (thường mang tính xã hội))] where she lives in Beechwood Road.
79.320000	89.830000		**For those of you that don’t already know**^[dành cho những ai chưa biết] – Street Play **involves**^[Bao gồm, đòi hỏi (một hành động nào đó)] local residents **closing off**^[ngăn không cho xe cộ đi vào] their street for a few hours so that children have a chance to play in the street safely.
90.000000	92.580000		She started it in her own street,
92.540000	95.550000		Beechwood Road, and the idea **caught on**^[catch on = được nhiều người ủng hộ / lan rộng],
95.580000	98.959773		and there are now Street Play Schemes **all over the city**^[khắp thành phố].
98.933369	102.080000		So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?

102.340000	107.020000	ALICE	Well, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a **toddler**^[trẻ mới biết đi (khoảng 1–3 tuổi)],
107.200000	110.049655		so that’s about six years ago now
110.076059	114.610000		– but it took at least two years of **campaigning**^[vận động, kêu gọi, đấu tranh (cho một ý tưởng)] before we were actually able to **make it happen**^[biến ý tưởng thành hiện thực].
114.960000	118.060000		So the scheme’s been **up and running**^[đã bắt đầu và đang hoạt động tốt] for three years now.
118.090000	125.364252		**We’d love to**^[would love to = rất muốn (dùng để nhận lời mời hoặc đề nghị một cách lịch sự)] be able to close our road for longer – **for the whole weekend**^[suốt cả cuối tuần], from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example.
125.670000	128.210000		At the moment it’s just once a week.
128.250000	132.660000		But when we started it was only once a month. But **we’re working on it**^[chúng tôi đang cố gắng / đang từng bước thực hiện].

132.590000	136.141495	PRESENTER	So what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?

136.141495	138.380000	ALICE	We have volunteer **wardens**^[người trông coi, giám sát (trật tự, an toàn)],
138.330000	142.056098		mostly parents but some elderly residents too,
142.029693	144.470000		who block off our road **at either end**^[ở cả hai đầu (đường)].
144.930000	147.838679		The council have provided special **signs**^[biển báo]
147.812274	149.922537		but there’s always a volunteer there
149.933638	152.920000		to explain what’s happening to any motorists.
153.280000	155.680000		Generally, they’re **fine about it**^[be fine about something = chấp nhận, không phản đối]
155.590000	159.230000		– we’ve only had to **get the police involved**^[nhờ cảnh sát can thiệp] **once or twice**^[rất hiếm khi (một hoặc hai lần)].

159.330000	164.510000		Now I should explain that the road isn’t completely closed to cars.
164.660000	167.240000		But only residents’ cars are allowed.
167.710000	171.730000		If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road,
171.770000	173.270000		it’s not a problem
173.250000	177.120000		– **as long as**^[miễn là] they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour.
177.560000	181.630000		But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time,
181.710000	183.860000		or they park in another street.
184.240000	187.734756		The wardens are only there to stop **through traffic**^[luồng xe đi xuyên qua (không có điểm đến trong khu vực đó)].

187.734756	191.340000	PRESENTER	So can anyone apply to get involved in Street Play?

191.390000	192.740000	ALICE	Absolutely
192.890000	195.790000		– we want to include all kids in the city
195.940000	199.060000		– especially those who live on busy roads.
199.123935	201.713935		It’s here that **demand is greatest**^[nhu cầu cao nhất].
202.510000	209.930000		Obviously, there isn’t such demand in **wealthier areas**^[khu vực giàu có hơn] where the children have access to parks or large gardens
210.060000	214.860000		– or in the **suburbs**^[khu ngoại ô] where there are usually more places for children to play outside.

215.790000	220.912743		I’d recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just **give it a go**^[don’t overthink, just try].
221.320000	225.770000		We’ve been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city.
225.950000	228.170000		And that’s not just parents.
228.230000	230.400000		There are always a few who **complain**^[phàn nàn]
230.390000	232.630000		but they’re a **tiny minority**^[một nhóm thiểu số rất nhỏ].
233.490000	234.523746		**On the whole**^[Nhìn chung / Nói chung]
234.505075	236.409496		everyone is very **supportive**^[ủng hộ]
236.390825	239.826250		and **say**^[they say] they’re very happy to see children out on the street
239.807579	242.200000		– even if it **does**^[dùng nhấn mạnh] **get**^[get + adjective = trở nên như thế nào đó.] **quite noisy**^[khá ồn].

279.202938	282.752938	ALICE	There have been so many benefits of Street Play for the kids.
282.970000	286.740000		Parents really like the fact that the kids are **getting fresh air**^[hít thở / hưởng không khí trong lành]
286.680000	289.640000		instead of sitting **staring**^[stare: nhìn chằm chằm] at a computer screen,
289.850000	293.060000		even if they’re not doing anything particularly **energetic**^[tốn nhiều sức / vận động mạnh].
293.730000	299.730000		And of course it’s great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents
300.570000	301.660000		– but for me
301.660000	308.110000		the biggest advantage is that kids **develop**^[phát triển, hình thành] **confidence**^[sự tự tin] **in themselves**^[vào chính bản thân] to be outside without their parents.
308.830000	313.910000		The other really fantastic thing is that children **get to know**^[làm quen / quen biết dần] the **adults in the street**^[người lớn trong khu phố]
314.080000	317.179317		– it’s like having a big extended family.

317.179317	319.610000	PRESENTER	It certainly does have a lot of benefits.
319.840000	324.690000		I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.

324.600000	328.730000	ALICE	Right. Well this was an **experiment**^[thử nghiệm] I was **involved in**^[tham gia, đóng vai trò trong]
328.690000	333.730000		where local residents decided to **try and reduce**^[try and + verb ≈ try to + verb] the traffic along King Street,
333.750000	336.470000		which is the **busiest**^[so sánh nhất của busy] main road in our area,
336.600000	340.500000		by **persuading**^[thuyết phục] people not to use their cars for one day.
341.260000	344.610000		We thought about **making**^[make someone do something = bắt / buộc ai làm gì] people pay more for parking
344.840000	347.650000		– but we decided that would be really unpopular
347.820000	351.540000		– so instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street
351.550000	353.640000		but **left**^[leave something open = cho phép tiếp tục sử dụng] the other car parks open.

354.260000	357.600000		It was surprising how much of a difference all this made.
358.470000	362.540000		As we’d **predicted**^[dự đoán], air quality was **significantly**^[rõ rệt, đáng kể] better
362.780000	366.490000		but what I hadn’t **expected**^[mong đợi, ngờ tới] was how much quieter it would be
366.710000	368.720000		– even with the buses still running.
369.620000	372.388832		Of course everyone said they felt safer
372.388832	376.760000		but we were actually **amazed**^[kinh ngạc] that sales in the shops went up **considerably**^[đáng kể] that day –
377.060000	380.400000		we thought there’d be fewer people out shopping – not more.

380.510000	381.990000	PRESENTER	That’s really interesting
381.940000	383.500000		so the fact that …
