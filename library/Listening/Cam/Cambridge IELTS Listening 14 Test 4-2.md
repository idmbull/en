0.123103	1.363103		Hello everyone.
1.313103	5.303103		I’m Jake Stevens and I’m your **rep**^[representative (người đại diện, người phụ trách)] here at the hotel.
5.383103	8.073103		I’m sure you’ll all have a great time here.
8.583103	11.983103		So let me tell you a bit about what’s on offer.
12.333103	17.103103		I’ll start by telling you about some of the **excursions**^[chuyến tham quan hoặc dã ngoại] that are available for guests.

17.963103	22.063103	One thing you have to do while you’re here is **go dolphin watching**^[đi xem cá heo (go + V-ing	cấu trúc chỉ hoạt động giải trí)].
22.623103	27.003103		On our boat trips, we **pretty well**^[gần như chắc chắn] **guarantee**^[bảo đảm] you’ll see dolphins
27.233103	30.633103		– if you don’t you can repeat the trip free of charge.
31.283103	35.173103		We organise daily trips for just 35 euros.
35.803103	40.183103		**Unfortunately**^[thật không may là] there aren’t any places **left**^[còn lại] for this afternoon’s trip,
40.373103	43.573103		but come and see me to book for later in the week.

44.533103	46.343103		If you’re **energetic**^[năng động],
46.273103	48.673103		I’d recommend our forest walk.
49.133103	52.573103		It’s a **guided walk**^[chuyển đi bộ có hướng dẫn] of about seven kilometres.
53.053103	58.283103		There’ll be a stop half way, and you’ll be provided with a drink and sandwiches.
58.833103	62.014180		There’s some **fairly**^[quite (tương đối)] **steep climbs**^[đoạn leo dốc] up the hills,
62.014180	65.073103		so you need to be **reasonably fit**^[tương đối khỏe] for this one,
65.133103	66.693103		with good shoes,
66.783103	69.633103		and bring a **waterproof**^[áo mưa] in case it rains.
70.123103	73.532231		It’s just 25 euros **all inclusive**^[đã bao gồm tất cả],
73.543545	75.383103		and it’s every Wednesday.

76.423103	78.123103		Then on Thursdays
78.133103	80.123103		we organise a cycle trip,
80.203103	84.013103		which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort.
84.653103	88.683103		We’ll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna,
88.753103	90.873103		and **leave**^[leave someone to + V: để ai đó tự làm gì] you to **bike back**^[đạp xe quay trở lại]
91.373103	95.527408		– it’s a **700-metre drop**^[độ chênh cao 700 mét] in just 20 kilometres
95.527408	101.183103		so this isn’t really for **inexperienced cyclists**^[người đi xe đạp thiếu kinh nghiệm] as you’ll be going pretty fast.
101.793103	105.513103		And if it’s a clear day, you’ll have fantastic views.

106.763103	108.943103		On our local **craft**^[nghề thủ công] tour
108.943103	112.763103		you can find out about the traditional activities in the island.
113.153103	115.253103		And the best thing about this trip
115.233103	117.383103		is that it’s completely free.
118.053103	121.473103		You’ll be taken to a factory where **jewellery**^[trang sức] is made,
121.543103	123.803103		and also a **ceramics**^[đồ gốm] centre.
124.353103	129.193103		If you want, you can buy some of the products but that’s entirely **up to you**^[do bạn quyết định].
129.903103	132.793103		The trip starts after lunch on Thursday,
132.803103	135.393103		and you’ll return by 6 pm.

136.513103	138.753103		If you’re interested in **astronomy**^[thiên văn học]
138.813103	144.753103		you may already know that the island’s one of the best places in the world to **observe**^[ngắm, quan sát] the night sky.
145.553103	149.963103		We can offer trips to the **observatory**^[đài thiên văn] on Friday for those who are interested.
150.513103	153.233103		They cost 90 euros per person
153.353103	157.863103		and you’ll be shown the **huge telescopes**^[khính thiên văn khổng lồ] and have a talk from an expert,
157.933103	160.593103		who’ll explain all about how they work.
161.403103	164.263103		Afterwards we’ll **head**^[to move in a particular direction] down to Sunset Beach,
164.293103	167.043103		where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want
167.123103	169.633103		before we head off back to the hotel.

170.673103	173.093103		Finally, there’s horse riding.
173.433103	178.353103		This is organised by the **Equestrian Centre**^[trung tâm cưỡi ngựa] **over near**^[ở gần (cách nói thân mật)] Playa Cortino
178.483103	182.123103		and it’s a great experience if you’re a **keen**^[rất thích, đam mê] **horseback rider**^[người cưỡi ngựa],
182.353103	185.113103		or even if you’ve never been on a horse before.
185.833103	187.833103		They take you down to the beach,
187.893103	191.443103		and you can **canter**^[chạy nước kiệu (tốc độ trung bình của ngựa)] along the **sand**^[bãi cát] and through the **waves**^[con sóng].
191.953103	194.213103		It costs 35 euros
194.163103	196.503103		and it’s available every day.

196.721099	200.091099		So there’s plenty to do in the daytime,
200.021099	201.911099		but what about night life?

202.551099	207.171099		Well, the number one **attraction’s**^[điểm thu hút] called ‘Musical Favourites’.
207.701099	212.121099		Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks,
212.211099	214.591099		and watch a fantastic show,
214.611099	217.441099		starting with **musicals**^[vở nhạc kịch] **set in**^[lấy bối cảnh tại] Paris
217.501099	220.301099		and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas
220.341099	222.491099		and finally Copacabana.
223.201099	224.251099		At the end
224.221099	229.101099		the **cast members**^[thành viên đoàn diễn] come down from the stage, still in their **stunning**^[lỗng lẫy] **costumes**^[trang phục diễn],
229.221099	231.551099		and you’ll have a chance to chat with them.
232.171099	239.901099		It’s hugely popular, so let me know now if you’re interested because it’s no good **leaving it**^[để việc đó] until the last minute.
240.381099	242.171099		It’s on Friday night.
242.441099	244.861099		Tickets are just 50 euros each,
245.041099	250.031099		but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage.

251.001099	253.261099		If you’d like to **go back in time**^[quay ngược thời gian (nghĩa bóng)],
253.391099	256.431099		there’s the Castle Feast on Saturday evening.
256.841099	259.551099		It’s held in a twelfth-century castle,
259.561099	261.921099		and you eat in the **great courtyard**^[sân lớn],
261.971099	265.501099		with ladies in **long gowns**^[váy mặc ở dạ hội] serving your food.
266.171099	268.571099		You’re given **a whole chicken**^[một con gà nguyên con] **each**^[mỗi người],
268.501099	270.708425		which you eat in the medieval way,
270.708425	273.231099		using your hands instead of **cutlery**^[dao nĩa (dùng cụ để ăn)],
273.621099	276.521099		and you’re entertained by competitions
276.501099	280.691099		where the horseback riders **attempt to**^[cố gắng] knock one another off their horses.
281.311099	286.311099		Then you can watch the dancers in the **ballroom**^[phòng khiêu vũ] and join in as well if you want.
287.171099	289.661099		OK, so now if anyone …
