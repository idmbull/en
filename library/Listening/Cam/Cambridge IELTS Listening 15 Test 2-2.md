0.000000	5.140000	WOMAN	I’m very pleased to welcome this evening’s guest speaker, Mark Logan,
5.110000	9.430000		who’s going to tell us about the recent transformation of Minster Park.
9.620000	11.160000		Over to you, Mark.

11.270000	12.230000	MARK	Thank you.
12.900000	16.370000		I’m sure you’re all familiar with Minster Park.
16.710000	20.050000		It’s been a feature of the city for well over a century,
20.190000	23.480000		and has been the responsibility of the city council
23.500000	25.210000		for most of that time.
25.790000	28.450000		What perhaps isn’t so well known
28.650000	30.610000		is the origin of the park:
31.670000	35.670000		unlike many public parks that started in private ownership,
35.720000	39.010000		as the garden of a large house, for instance,
39.260000	42.380000		Minster was some waste land,
42.620000	48.640000		which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892.
49.470000	52.610000		It was unclear who actually owned the land,
52.950000	56.560000		and this wasn’t settled until 20 years later,
56.720000	58.990000		when the council took possession of it.

59.800000	63.900000		You may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances.
64.310000	66.730000		It’s of Diane Gosforth,
66.810000	70.030000		who played a key role in the history of the park.
70.580000	73.390000		Once the council had become the legal owner,
73.630000	76.220000		it planned to sell the land for housing.
77.020000	81.780000		Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to,
82.120000	85.400000		to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment –
85.750000	90.530000		remember the park is in a densely populated residential area.
91.530000	94.830000		Diane Gosforth was one of those people,
95.390000	99.000000		and she organised petitions and demonstrations,
99.190000	104.510000		which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.

105.460000	109.350000		Soon after this the First World War broke out,
109.360000	111.340000		in 1914,
111.660000	115.750000		and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables,
115.740000	117.560000		which were sold locally.
118.210000	123.430000		At one stage the army considered taking in over for troop exercises
123.610000	126.800000		and got as far as contacting the city council,
127.060000	131.500000		then decided the park was too small to be of use.
132.300000	135.710000		There were occasional public meetings during the war,
135.920000	139.200000		in an area that had been retained as grass.

139.910000	141.090000		After the war,
141.080000	147.160000		the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914,
147.460000	151.340000		and continued almost unchanged until recently.
152.350000	156.480000		Plans for transforming it were drawn up at various times,
156.670000	159.600000		most recently in 2013,
159.760000	162.750000		though they were revised in 2015,
162.960000	165.060000		before any work had started.
166.050000	169.990000		The changes finally got going in 2016,
170.270000	173.130000		and were finished on schedule last year.

173.515997	178.525997		OK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made
178.475997	180.935997		– and some things that have been retained.
181.435997	183.375997		If you look at this map,
183.515997	186.225997		you’ll see the familiar outline of the park,
186.365997	189.585997		with the river forming the northern boundary,
189.805997	193.805997		and a gate in each of the other three walls.
194.455997	197.865997		The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved:
198.405997	200.965997		it used to be close to the south gate,
201.415997	205.255997		but it’s now immediately to the north of the lily pond,
205.415997	207.405997		almost in the centre of the park,
207.615997	209.865997		which makes it much more visible.

211.395997	214.535997		There’s a new area of wooden sculptures,
214.525997	216.165417		which are on the river bank,
216.165417	219.785997		where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend.

221.195997	224.955997		There are two areas that are particularly intended for children.
225.655997	228.745997		The playground has been enlarged and improved,
228.885997	230.885997		and that’s between the river
230.895997	234.245997		and the path that leads from the pond to the river.

236.065997	238.435997		Then there’s a new maze,
238.455997	242.715997		a circular series of paths, separated by low hedges.
243.015997	245.415997		That’s near the west gate
245.805997	248.535997		– you go north from there towards the river
248.725997	251.215997		and then turn left to reach it.

252.665997	255.945997		There have been tennis courts in the park for many years,
256.095997	257.895997		and they’ve been doubled,
258.006691	259.909377		from four to eight.
260.685997	263.575997		They’re still in the south-west corner of the park,
263.765997	266.585997		where there’s a right-angle bend in the path.

267.475997	271.715997		Something else I’d like to mention is the new fitness area.
272.095997	277.015997		This is right next to the lily pond on the same side as the west gate.

278.005997	280.945997		Now, as you’re all gardeners,
281.165997	285.445997		I’m sure you’ll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.
