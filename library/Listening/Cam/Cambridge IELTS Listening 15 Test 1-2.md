0.000000	1.374091		Good morning.
1.444091	3.844091		My name’s Erica Matthews,
3.824091	10.414091		and I’m the owner of Matthews Island Holidays,
3.824091	10.414091		a company set up by my parents.
10.754091	16.804091		Thank you for coming to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer.
17.264091	19.984091		We’re a small, family-run company,
20.004091	23.734091		and we **believe in**^[tin vào] the importance of the **personal touch**^[cảm nhận cá nhân],
23.844091	28.614091		so we don’t **aim to**^[nhắm đến, hướng tới] compete with other companies on the number of customers.
28.894091	32.944091		What we do is **build on**^[phát triển hoặc mở rộng dựa trên một nền tảng đã có sẵn.] our many years’ experience
32.874091	36.334091		– more than almost any other **rail holiday company**^[công ty du lịch đường sắt]
36.364091	41.524091		– to **ensure**^[đảm bảo] we provide perfect holidays in a small number of **destinations**^[điểm đến du lịch],
41.514091	44.794091		which we’ve got to know extremely well.

45.404091	48.834091		I’ll start with our six-day **Isle**^[hòn đảo (thường là đảo nhỏ)] of **Man**^[tên riêng] holiday.
48.944091	52.524091		This is a **fascinating**^[cực kỳ thú vị (extremely interesting and attractive)] island in the Irish Sea,
52.504091	54.354091		with Wales to the south,
54.274091	59.424091		England to the east, Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west.
59.854091	62.604091		Our holiday starts in Heysham,
62.564091	65.064091		where your tour manager will meet you,
64.984091	68.324091		then you’ll travel by **ferry**^[phà] to the Isle of Man.
68.524091	71.584091		Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead,
71.574091	76.894091		and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.

77.504091	80.064091		You have five nights in the hotel,
80.084091	83.434091		and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners,
83.354091	87.674091		and lunch on the three days when there are organised trips:
87.814091	93.664091		day four is free, and most people have lunch in a cafe or restaurant in Douglas.

94.284091	97.944091		The price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man,
97.984091	103.074091		all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I’ve mentioned.
103.344091	108.734091		**Incidentally**^[dùng để chuyển chủ đề hoặc bổ sung thông tin một cách tự nhiên.], we try to make booking our holidays **as simple and fair as possible**^[đơn giản và công bằng nhất có thể (as … as possible càng … càng tốt)],
108.704091	115.374091		so unlike with many companies, the price is the same **whether**^[cho dù] you book six months in advance
115.364091	120.354091		or at the last minute, and there’s no **supplement**^[phụ phí] for single rooms in hotels.
120.934091	126.084091		If you make a booking then need to change the start date, for example because of **illness**^[ốm đau],
126.034091	130.024091		you’re welcome to change to an **alternative date**^[ngày thay thế (alternative: that can be used instead of something else)] or a different tour,
130.004091	132.244091		for a small **administrative fee**^[phí hành chính, phí giấy tờ].

133.112093	136.862093		OK, so what does the holiday consist of?
136.952093	138.892093		Well, on day one
138.852093	145.202093		you’ll arrive **in time**^[kịp lúc (on time = đúng giờ)] for a **short introduction**^[buổi giới thiệu ngắn] by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel.
145.512093	148.112093		The dining room looks out at the river,
148.102093	150.562093		close to where it flows into the **harbour**^[bến cảng],
150.472093	153.552093		and there’s usually plenty of activity going on.

154.052093	158.482093		On day two you’ll take the **coach**^[xe khách] to the small town of Peel,
158.412093	162.202093		on the way **calling in at**^[ghé thăm (trong thời gian ngắn)] the Tynwald **Exhibition**^[triển lãm].
162.722093	165.922093		The Isle of Man isn’t part of the United Kingdom,
165.912093	169.532093		and it has its own **parliament**^[nghị viện], called Tynwald.
169.932093	174.992093		It’s **claimed that**^[cho rằng] this is the world’s oldest parliament that’s **still functioning**^[vẫn còn hoạt động],
175.072093	178.412093		and that it **dates back to**^[có từ / bắt nguồn từ] 979.
178.632093	184.552093		However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from 1422,
184.512093	188.552093		so perhaps it isn’t quite as old as it claims!

189.182093	193.354181		Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell.
193.502093	199.762093		This begins with a **leisurely**^[thong thả, thư thả] **ride**^[chuyến đi (trên phương tiện)] along the **promenade**^[đường đi bộ thường ở ven biển] in Douglas in a **horse-drawn tram**^[xe được kéo bằng ngựa)].
200.062093	205.912093		Then you **board**^[get on; lên xe/tàu/máy bay)] an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey.
206.252093	212.652093		From there it’s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the top.
213.112093	214.822093		Lunch will be in the cafe,
214.732093	218.082093		giving you spectacular views of the island.

219.322093	224.392093		Day four is free for you to explore, using the **pass**^[thẻ / vé sử dụng nhiều dịch vụ] which we’ll give you.
224.572093	227.972093		So you won’t have to pay for travel on local transport,
227.942093	231.142093		or for entrance to the island’s **heritage sites**^[địa điểm di sản].
231.432093	236.772093		Or you might just want to **take it easy**^[nghỉ ngơi, thư giãn] in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.

237.692093	240.502093		The last full day, day five,
240.482093	243.712093		is for some people the highlight of the holiday,
243.652093	248.702093		with a ride on the steam railway, from Douglas to Port Erin.
249.312093	251.452093		After **some time**^[khoảng thời gian] to explore,
251.382093	258.542093		a coach will take you to the **headland**^[Một dải đất hẹp, thường cao và dốc (như vách đá), nhô ra khỏi bờ biển và đi sâu vào biển.] that overlooks the Calf of Man, a small island just off the coast.
258.642093	261.652093		From there you continue to Castletown,
261.582093	264.542093		which used to be the capital of the Isle of Man,
264.452093	266.412093		and its **mediaeval castle**^[lâu đài thời trung cổ].

267.252093	270.772093		And on day six it’s back to the ferry
270.762093	273.492093		– or the airport, if you flew to the island
273.452093	275.542093		– and time to go home.

276.282093	278.252093		Now I’d like to tell you …
