0.000000	2.120684		Hello and welcome.
2.340684	4.530684		My name's Heather McCallum
4.560684	9.130684		and I'm one of the **potters**^[thợ gốm] who work here at Edelman **Pottery**^[xưởng gốm; nghề làm gốm].
9.710684	11.870684		Before we go into the workshop,
11.990684	15.600684		I just want to say a bit about the **craft of pottery**^[nghề gốm thủ công].
15.920684	18.670684		Then we'll have a look at the equipment
18.820684	21.870684		and you can try making a pot of your own.
22.310684	24.170684		Like many people,
24.260684	27.820684		I'm sure you know that pottery as an **art form**^[loại hình nghệ thuật]
27.770684	30.700684		is **tens of thousands of**^[hàng chục ngàn] years old.
30.940684	32.460684		And we know this
32.590684	35.360684		because it **stands the test of time**^[trường tồn với thời gian].
35.730684	38.600684		Things like baskets and pictures
38.670684	42.790684		don't **survive**^[tồn tại nguyên vẹn, không bị phá hủy hoặc mục nát qua thời gian] in the earth in the same way that pots do.
43.100684	47.370684		And even if ancient pots are found in small pieces,
47.600684	51.760684		they still provide a lot of information about the past.
52.600684	57.025914		There's no doubt that pottery has given **archaeologists**^[nhà khảo cổ học]
56.960684	61.490684		a **fascinating**^[thú vị] **insight**^[cái nhìn sâu sắc] into how ancient humans lived.
62.150684	65.490684		The shape of an **artefact**^[hiện vật] may have been lost,
65.730684	71.355914		but archaeologists can tell whether the pots were for, **say**^[Ví dụ như / Giả sử như (tương đương với for example hoặc for instance)], storage
71.280684	72.520684		or cooking
72.550684	77.810684		by examining the **impressions**^[dấu vết] on the clay, the **scratches**^[vết trầy xước] from tools.
78.300684	80.472575		And the clay itself
80.350684	83.160684		can **reveal**^[tiết lộ] where the pots came from.
84.510684	89.350684		When I ask people why they want to take a pottery class with me,
89.580684	92.260684		they sometimes talk about these things.
92.570684	94.570684		Like our ancestors,
94.610684	97.250684		they hope that something they create
97.250684	100.500684		will also last longer than they do.
100.670684	104.050684		That their **work**^[tác phẩm], whether it is good or not,
104.290684	109.550684		might say something about **humanity**^[loài người] many years after their death.
110.600684	115.120684		Of course, you will all have your own reasons for coming here.
115.390684	117.480684		**As far as I'm concerned**^[I think, In my opinion],
117.420684	122.580684		what I love most is the **concentration**^[sự tập trung] you need to make a good pot.
123.470684	128.220684		That focus takes you away from the stresses of everyday life.
128.740684	130.300684		If you're elderly,
130.340684	134.022929		it's also good exercise for hands and **wrists**^[cổ tay]
134.020684	135.800684		and helps with **arthritis**^[viêm khớp].
136.070684	139.800684		And of course, it's a fun activity for children,
139.740684	141.390684		because it's so messy.
142.070684	144.390684		Here at Edelman Pottery,
144.380684	147.764758		we show you some of the basic pottery techniques
147.760684	151.280684		so that you can use these to create whatever you wish.
151.290684	153.440684		A gift for a friend, perhaps.
154.140684	156.820684		Like nearly everyone who comes here,
156.790684	160.340684		I'm sure this is the first time you will have tried the art,
160.630684	163.100684		so we'll keep things simple today.
164.010684	166.490684		Now, before we move on,
166.500684	169.550684		can I just say a word about what you're wearing?
169.900684	172.100684		As we said in our email,
172.160684	176.710684		please remove any watches, **necklaces**^[vòng cổ], etc.,
176.760684	178.730684		and put them somewhere safe.
179.240684	181.270684		If you have long hair,
181.190684	183.520684		do tie it back now.
183.760684	186.030684		We'll provide **aprons**^[tạp dề] later,
186.140684	189.810684		but I trust your clothes are old but comfortable,
189.870684	192.670684		not your favourite T-shirt or jeans.

193.593426	196.333426		So now we're in the workshop.
196.433426	198.043426		Have a look around.
198.183426	199.953426		There's a lot **going on**^[đang diễn ra (happening)].
200.323426	202.773426		To make pottery that will last,
202.733426	204.653426		you need a **potter's wheel**^[bàn xoay gốm],
204.793426	205.863426		a **kiln**^[lò nung (gốm, gạch...)],
205.973426	210.623426		which is basically a very hot oven where you fire the pottery,
210.943426	212.433426		and some tools.
213.653426	216.213426		So first, the kiln.
216.553426	221.043426		If you look over in the far corner, you'll see one of ours.
221.573426	225.333426		Since their invention, kilns have changed very little,
225.603426	227.953426		though in the past 20 years
227.963426	231.683426		a lot of **progress**^[bước tiến] has been made in temperature control.
232.043426	236.153426		Basically, a kiln removes the water from clay
236.203426	240.423426		at temperatures of around 1,000 degrees Celsius.
241.053426	243.313426		This allows anything you've made
243.373426	246.093426		to set permanently in shape.
246.803426	249.713426		It's a pretty ugly, heavy object
249.853426	252.533426		that's hard to keep in a house or flat,
252.733426	254.833426		so most people don't have one.

255.333426	256.633426		You may think,
256.713426	259.193426		can't I use my oven?
259.523426	261.563426		Well, that's possible,
261.753426	265.372351		but **domestic**^[dân dụng] ovens don't really get hot enough,
265.313426	269.233426		and eventually the clay will **crack**^[rạn nứt] and **fall apart**^[rơi rụng rời rạc ra từng mảnh, vỡ vụn, rã đám].
269.873426	272.203426		Some people fire pottery
272.133426	274.663426		in a **fire pit**^[hố lửa] outside,
274.823426	276.853426		but **bear in mind**^[Remember (Hãy mang cái thông tin này đặt vào trong tâm trí của bạn và giữ chặt nó ở đó)]
276.773426	278.603426		that can be dangerous.
279.443426	283.373426		You also need to know about safety procedures for kilns
283.413426	286.913426		as they release **toxic compounds**^[hợp chất độc hại] into the air.
288.353426	291.983426		Every potter needs a potter's wheel.
292.433426	296.633426		This machine is used to shape the clay into an object
296.743426	299.623426		with circular walls or sides,
299.813426	301.633426		such as a bowl.
302.343426	304.003426		Its invention
303.933426	306.973426		revolutionised the pottery industry,
307.003426	311.003426		allowing multiple items to be produced in a day.
311.683426	312.903426		Lastly,
312.973426	316.743426		there are a number of different tools that potters use,
316.783426	319.283426		depending on what they want to make.
319.703426	321.123426		When you start,
321.053426	327.333426		your hands can make all kinds of shapes and curves without **relying on**^[dựa vào] a sculpting tool.
327.713426	334.393426		However, there are some basic tools that you will need to handle the clay on the wheel.
334.923426	337.483426		Some look very strange
337.403426	339.803426		and have even **odder names**^[tên kỳ cục]
339.833426	342.313426		that you may find hard to remember.
342.783426	345.493426		Rather than go through them all now,
345.613426	349.013426		I'll just name a few tools **as we go along**^[khi chúng ta tiến hành].
349.273426	351.083426		We can provide these,
351.113426	354.720971		and I wouldn't recommend spending money on them yet.
355.643426	359.987781		So, let's try making a pot of your own.
