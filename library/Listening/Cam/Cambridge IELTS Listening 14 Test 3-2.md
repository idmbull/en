0.041434	3.021434		Good morning. My name’s Lucy Crittenden,
3.071434	10.251434		and I’m the **Director of Operations**^[giám đốc điều hành] for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country.
10.721434	16.051434		I’m hoping I can **persuade**^[thuyết phục] one or two of you to become volunteers yourselves.
16.221434	20.421434		Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.

21.021434	23.791434		Volunteers are teenagers and adults
23.751434	28.811434		who choose to spend some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way.
29.081434	33.081434		Most volunteers **devote**^[dành (thời gian, công sức)] two or three hours to this every week,
33.091434	35.071434		while a few do much more.
35.431434	40.111434		The people they help may have physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.

40.981434	43.791434		Volunteers can do all sorts of things,
43.881434	47.381434		depending on their own **abilities**^[khả năng] and interests.
47.681434	50.971434		If they’re supporting a family that’s **struggling**^[đang gặp khó khăn (tài chính, cuộc sống…)], for example,
51.101434	54.101434		they may be able to give them tips on cooking,
54.031434	56.571434		or recommend how to plan their budget
56.591434	59.661434		or how to shop sensibly on their income.
60.251434	63.461434		They might even do **some painting**^[trông trẻ] or wallpapering,
63.431434	68.021434		perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it.
68.321434	70.271434		Or even do some babysitting
70.191434	72.681434		so that parents can go out for a while.

73.581434	78.401434		The benefit from volunteering isn’t only for the people being helped.
78.731434	81.161434		Volunteers also gain from it:
81.311434	86.421434		they’re using their skills to **cope**^[đối phó (với khó khăn, vấn đề)] with somebody’s mental or physical ill health,
86.571434	92.371434		and volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they’re applying for jobs:
92.901434	98.001434		employers usually **look favourably on**^[đánh giá cao / có thiện cảm với] someone who’s **given up time**^[hy sinh thời gian] to help others.
98.331434	99.631434		Significantly,
99.661434	104.711434		most volunteers feel that what they’re doing gives them **a purpose**^[một mục đích / ý nghĩa] in their lives.
105.011434	108.251434		And in my opinion, they’re lucky **in that respect**^[trong khía cạnh đó],
108.251434	110.901434		as many people don’t have that feeling.

111.127497	115.927497		Now I’d like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do,
115.937497	120.197497		to give you an idea of the range of ways in which they can help people.

120.767497	125.537497		Habib supports an elderly lady who’s beginning to show signs of **dementia**^[mất trí nhớ].
126.037497	129.557497		Once a week they, along with other elderly people,
129.597497	132.017497		go to the local community centre,
131.977497	134.427497		where a group of people come in and sing.
134.727497	137.557497		The songs take the listeners back to their youth,
137.757497	139.327497		and for a little while
139.317497	142.257497		they can forget the difficulties that they face now.

142.927497	146.127497		Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman.
146.357497	150.987497		She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn’t let that stop her.
151.477497	154.747497		She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties,
154.717497	157.507497		who had almost stopped walking **altogether**^[hoàn toàn].
157.977497	160.377497		By using herself as an example,
160.367497	164.207497		Consuela **encourages**^[khuyến khích, động viên] them to walk more and more.

165.317497	170.607497		Minh visits a young man who lives alone and can’t leave his home on his own,
170.717497	173.257497		so he **hardly ever**^[hiếm khi] saw anyone.
173.437497	175.687497		But together they go out to the cinema,
175.767497	180.117497		or to see friends the young man hadn’t been able to visit for a long time.

180.907497	184.167497		Tanya visits an elderly woman once a week.
184.427497	188.327497		When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional **dressmaker**^[thợ may],
188.317497	189.887497		she got interested.
190.457497	193.837497		Tanya showed her some **soft toys**^[thú nhồi bông] she’d made,
193.757497	196.307497		and the woman decided to try it herself.
196.437497	201.297497		And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys.
201.627497	204.867497		They’re not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet,
204.857497	207.417497		but she gains a lot of **pleasure**^[niềm vui, sự thích thú] from doing it.

208.127497	213.137497		Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties.
213.547497	217.777497		By calmly **talking over**^[thảo luận, bàn bạc] possible solutions with family members,
217.797497	221.287497		he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t **helpless**^[bất lực],
221.347497	225.047497		and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation.
225.497497	228.097497		This has been great for their **self-esteem**^[sự tự tin, lòng tự trọng].

228.707497	231.517497		And the last volunteer I’ll mention,
231.447497	233.297497		though there are plenty more,
233.207497	234.227497		is Juba.
234.747497	238.537497		She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties,
238.497497	241.267497		who wasn’t very good at talking to other people.
241.617497	244.317497		Juba’s worked very patiently with her,
244.487497	247.887497		and now the girl is far better at expressing herself,
247.987497	250.507497		and at understanding other people.

251.267497	256.267497		OK, I hope that’s given you an idea of what volunteering is all about.
256.337497	257.957497		Now I’d like …
