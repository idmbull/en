0.052590	4.172590		We’ll be arriving at Branley Castle in about five minutes,
4.442590	10.532590		but before we get there I’ll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include.

11.332590	16.812590		So in fact there’s been a castle on this site for over eleven hundred years.
17.212590	19.182590		The first building was a **fort**^[pháo đài]
19.102590	24.472590		constructed in 914 AD for defence against **Danish invaders**^[quân xâm lược Đan Mạch]
24.402590	26.662590		by King Alfred the Great’s daughter,
26.692590	28.582590		who ruled England at the time.
29.422590	33.118416		In the following century, after the Normans **conquered**^[chinh phục] England,
33.118416	36.772590		the land was given to a **nobleman**^[quý tộc] called Richard de Vere,
36.902590	42.842590		and he built a castle there that **stayed in the de Vere family**^[stay in a family: thuộc về một gia tộc] for over four hundred years.

43.442590	49.232590		However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576
49.292590	51.732590		it was beginning to look a bit **run down**^[xuống cấp],
52.102590	55.771100		and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms,
55.771100	59.792590		they’d make a new house for her out of wood next to the main hall.
60.112590	64.422590		She stayed there for four nights and **apparently**^[dường như / theo những gì được biết] it was very luxurious,
64.742590	69.222590		but **unfortunately**^[đáng tiếc là] it was destroyed a few years later by fire.

69.822590	71.942590		In the seventeenth century
71.852590	75.672590		the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenys family,
75.802590	78.532590		who **enlarged**^[mở rộng] it and made it more **comfortable**^[tiện nghi].
78.782590	84.271845		However, by 1982 the Fenys family **could no longer afford to**^[không còn đủ khả năng tài chính để] maintain the castle,
84.271845	86.602590		even though they received government support,
86.542590	88.342590		and they put it on the market.
88.982590	91.704757		It was **eventually**^[rốt cuộc] **taken over**^[tiếp quản] by a company
91.704757	93.932590		who owned a number of **amusement parks**^[công viên giải trí],
94.192590	99.582590		but when we get there I think you’ll see that they’ve managed to **retain**^[giữ lại, duy trì] the original atmosphere of the castle.

100.292590	103.702590		When you go inside, you’ll find that in the **state rooms**^[phòng nghi lễ / phòng quốc yến]
103.762590	109.482590		there are life-like moving **wax models**^[tượng sáp] dressed in costumes of different periods in the past,
109.612590	112.302590		which even **carry on**^[tiến hành] conversations together.
112.702590	114.795737		As well as that, in every room
114.795737	119.082590		there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for
119.062590	122.792590		and the history of the objects and **furniture**^[đồ nội thất] it contains.

124.042590	127.122590		The castle park’s quite **extensive**^[rộng lớn].
127.082590	129.732590		At one time sheep were kept there,
129.772590	134.522590		and in the nineteenth century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits
134.582590	136.432590		and even a baby elephant.
136.752590	142.398855		Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for public displays of painting and sculpture.
143.042590	146.502590		The park also has some beautiful trees,
146.642590	151.332590		though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years,
151.462590	154.242590		was sadly **blown down**^[gió quật đổ] in 1987.

154.892590	159.032590		Now, you’re free to **wander around**^[đi dạo, đi lang thang] **on your own**^[một mình / tự do] until 4.30,
159.262590	164.822590		but then at the end of our visit we’ll all meet together at the bottom of the **Great Staircase**^[Cầu thang Lớn].
165.032590	167.132590		We’ll then go on to the long gallery,
167.132590	169.862952		where there’s a wonderful collection of photographs
169.862952	172.862590		showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago
172.792590	175.262590		having tea and cakes in the conservatory
175.592590	180.702590		– and we’ll then take you to the same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you.

181.380652	187.710652		Now if you can take a look at your plans you’ll see Branley Castle has four towers,
187.630652	188.990652		**joined together**^[nối liền với nhau]
188.910652	190.390652		by a high wall,
190.340652	192.320652		with the river on two sides.

192.670652	195.110652		Don’t miss seeing the Great Hall.
195.130652	202.350652		That’s near the river in the main tower, the biggest one, which was extended and redesigned in the eighteenth century.

203.220652	207.830652		If you want to get a good view of the whole castle, you can walk around the walls.
207.900652	210.590652		The starting point’s quite near the main entrance
210.510652	214.490652		– **walk straight down**^[đi thẳng xuống] the path until you get to the south gate,
214.470652	215.770652		and it’s just there.
215.940652	217.810652		Don’t go on to the north gate
218.010652	219.650652		– there’s no way up from there.

220.710652	224.590652		There’ll shortly be a show in which you can see **archers**^[cung thủ]
224.500652	227.290652		displaying their skill with a bow and arrow.
227.460652	235.285165		The quickest way to get there is to take the first left after the main entrance and follow the path past the bridge,
235.800652	238.410652		then you’ll see it in front of you at the end.

239.370652	240.850652		If you like animals
240.860652	246.390652		there’s also a display of **hunting birds**^[chim săn mồi] – **falcons**^[chim ưng] and **eagles**^[đại bàng] and so on.
246.760652	248.930652		If you go from the main entrance
248.840652	250.980652		in the direction of the south gate,
251.070652	254.870652		but turn right before you get there instead of going through it,
254.780652	258.270652		you’ll see it on your right past the first tower.

259.220652	263.460652		At 3 pm there’s a short performance of traditional dancing
263.380652	265.020652		on the outdoor stage.
265.180652	268.650652		That’s right at the other side of the castle from the entrance,
268.590652	269.950652		and over the bridge.
269.990652	272.120652		It’s about ten minutes’ walk or so.

272.750652	274.070652		And finally
274.050652	275.090652		the shop.
275.510652	278.260652		It’s actually inside one of the towers,
278.330652	281.070652		but the way in is from the outside.
281.170652	285.150652		Just take the first left after the main entrance, go down the path
285.130652	286.740652		and take the first right.
286.770652	289.490652		It’s got some lovely gifts and **souvenirs**^[đồ lưu niệm].

289.900652	292.560652		Right, so we’re just arriving …
