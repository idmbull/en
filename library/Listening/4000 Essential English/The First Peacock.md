4.140000	6.630000		Argos lived in **Ancient Greece**^[Hy Lạp Cổ Đại].
6.870000	9.857117		He was a husband and a **proud**^[People who feel proud are happy about what they have done.] father.
10.140000	13.568327		He worked hard and did well at his job.
14.060000	16.910000		But one thing about him wasn't normal.
17.260000	20.180000		He was born with 100 eyes.
20.670000	24.630000		Having many eyes was usually a **benefit**^[A benefit is a good thing.] to him.
24.880000	27.730000		He had a **chance**^[A chance is an opportunity to do something.] to see many things.

28.720000	32.030000		Also, since he had so many eyes,
32.180000	35.270000		he was very good at **guarding**^[To guard something is to take care of it.] things.
35.810000	37.150000		While sleeping,
37.200000	40.240000		he only **rested**^[To rest is to stop being active while the body gets back its strength.] a few eyes at a time.
40.485926	42.425926		The others stayed open.
42.930000	44.400000		He worked for Hera,
44.410000	46.130000		a great **goddess**^[nữ thần].
46.490000	50.180000		His **primary**^[If something is primary, it is the most important thing.] **function**^[The function of something is what it does.] was to guard a special cow.
50.670000	53.680000		The cow was very important to Hera.
54.040000	55.390000		She loved it.
55.750000	58.350000		The most **essential**^[If something is essential, it is very important and necessary.] part of his job
58.350000	60.680000		was to keep the cow alone.
60.960000	64.710000		It had to be kept **separate**^[If two things are separate, they are not together.] from all the other cows
64.750000	67.350000		and **far**^[If something is far, it is not close.] away from people.

68.400000	71.350000		This was an easy job for Argos.
71.660000	74.140000		The cow just ate **grass**^[Grass is the green leaves that cover the ground.] all day.
74.780000	77.940000		But the god Zeus wanted the cow.
78.270000	80.980000		He wanted to take it away from Hera.
81.430000	82.920000		He had a plan.
83.330000	85.850000		He found a great music player.
86.240000	90.410000		He asked the man to play a beautiful song for Argos.
90.810000	94.250000		Zeus was **certain**^[If you are certain about something, you know it is true.] Argos would go to sleep.

94.790000	97.620000		The song had an **immediate**^[If something is immediate, it happens quickly.] **effect**^[An effect is a change made by something else.].
98.090000	100.870000		Argos couldn't **focus**^[To focus on something is to think about it and pay attention to it.] on his job.
101.160000	102.550000		He **fell asleep**^[ngủ quên (fall: ngã, rơi → chuyển sang trạng thái; asleep (tính từ): đang ngủ, ngủ rồi)].

103.640000	105.200000		Zeus saw this,
105.140000	106.950000		and he took the cow.
107.450000	110.210000		Hera was very angry with Argos.
110.450000	112.710000		She **turned**^[biến] him into a **peacock**^[con công].
113.100000	116.000000		She put his many eyes on his **tail**.
116.500000	118.660000		Argos was very sad.
119.080000	122.770000		Zeus saw how much **trouble**^[Trouble is a problem or a difficulty.] he had given Argos.
123.130000	124.910000		He made another plan.
125.280000	128.460000		He turned Argos into a group of stars.
128.810000	132.330000		He wanted Argos to **remain**^[To remain somewhere is to stay there.] in the sky forever.
132.850000	134.020000		Even today,
134.140000	136.370000		Argos' **image**^[The image of something is a picture of it.] remains there,
136.320000	139.740000		above the **site**^[A site is a place.] where all his problems began.
140.040000	143.250000		We can still see him in the night sky.
