4.160000	6.410000		Katie the **kitten**^[mèo con] liked to play.
6.750000	7.720000		One day,
7.760000	9.520000		Cory the **caterpillar**^[con sâu]
9.500000	11.910000		**emerged**^[To emerge from something means to come out of it.] from a hole in the wall
11.900000	14.500000		while Katie was playing in the living room.

15.000000	17.070000		"Hey!" Katie said.
17.330000	19.290000		"Do you want to play with me?"

20.010000	21.700000		Cory was **reluctant**^[Reluctant means not wanting to do something.].
21.890000	22.770000		He said,
23.120000	25.410000		"I'd rather not play with you.
25.620000	27.810000		I have several **handicaps**^[A handicap is a condition that limits someone's mental or physical abilities.].
28.090000	30.380000		My body is very **delicate**^[Delicate things are easy to break or harm.].
30.680000	33.420000		Your **claws**^[móng vuốt] are as sharp as **hooks**^[A hook is a sharp curved piece of metal used for catching or holding things.].
33.600000	35.080000		You might cut me.
35.550000	37.810000		Plus, I have no bones,
37.850000	39.530000		not even a **spine**^[xương sống].
39.790000	41.740000		You could easily hurt me.”

42.980000	45.370000		"I **swear**^[To swear means to promise to do something.] that I won't hurt you,"
45.650000	46.790000		Katie said.

47.210000	49.130000		"No, I don't want to,”
49.330000	50.490000		he said again.
50.820000	52.320000		He **hopped**^[To hop means to jump a short distance.] from the wall,
52.540000	54.360000		but Katie **pursued**^[To pursue is to chase or follow someone or something.] him.

55.000000	58.500000		Cory ran into the kitchen and into the **cupboard**^[tủ bếp],
58.670000	61.160000		but Katie ran right behind.
61.820000	64.410000		Katie knocked **appliances**^[đồ gia dụng] to the floor.
64.700000	66.620000		Plates fell into the **sink**^[bồn rửa]
66.590000	68.420000		and broke in the **basin**^[A basin is large bowl for washing things. A sink is sometimes called a basin.].

68.750000	71.920000		Then, Cory ran into a bedroom.
72.110000	74.330000		Some **laundry**^[Laundry is clothes that have been or need to be washed.] was on the floor.
74.690000	76.740000		Cory hid under a shirt,
76.880000	78.600000		but Katie saw him.
78.740000	80.710000		She jumped on the shirt.
81.030000	83.310000		Her **paws**^[Bàn chân (của động vật) – đặc biệt là chó, mèo, gấu, sư tử…] left **stains**^[vết bẩn] on it,
83.440000	86.980000		and her claws tore the **sleeves**^[tay áo] into **strips**^[A strip is a long, narrow piece of material or land.].

87.470000	89.850000		However, Cory escaped.
90.050000	93.290000		He used a small hole in the floor to hide.
93.740000	95.560000		But Katie saw him.

96.180000	97.810000		"Now you are cought!"
97.980000	99.110000		said Katie.

99.830000	102.780000		Cory tried to avoid Katie's claws.
102.960000	106.490000		He moved his body as far into the hole as possible.
106.740000	109.470000		He didn't know how he'd get out of the **hole**.

110.550000	111.610000		Just then,
111.690000	113.550000		Katie's owner came home.
113.970000	116.710000		She saw that the house was a mess.
117.020000	120.000000		She took a **broom**^[cái chổi] and **swung**^[Vung tay hoặc vung vũ khí theo đường vòng cung để đánh ai đó.] it at Katie.
120.280000	122.910000		She chased Katie out of the house.

123.490000	124.870000		Cory was safe,
124.980000	127.350000		and Katie was left outside
127.430000	131.080000		because she didn't listen to the wishes of others.
