4.250000	9.420000		**Cancer** is a **disease**^[bệnh tật] that develops because of unusual **cell**^[tế bào] growth in the human body.
9.950000	13.120000		Cancer cells take over and attack healthy cells,
13.140000	16.690000		**leaving**^[khiến] the normal working cells in a state of **destruction**^[sự phát hủy, hủy diệt].

17.940000	22.810000		**Extensive research**^[những nghiên cứu sâu rộng] has been done to understand the link between genes and cancer.
23.800000	27.790000		A gene is what decides the traits a living thing may **inherit**^[di truyền].
28.340000	31.910000		Genes can be found in the **DNA**^[ADN] of each cell in the body.
32.810000	38.740000		DNA contains a code that carries all the needed information about the qualities of a living thing.
39.760000	44.750000		Genes control how cells work by making proteins that have special jobs.
45.540000	47.990000		These proteins make up everything
48.130000	52.780000		— bones, teeth, muscles, blood^[máu], etc. — in our bodies.
53.950000	57.010000		Genes **pass on**^[Pass on somthing to someone: chuyển tiếp] the DNA code to proteins
56.970000	58.620000		that decide eye color,
58.570000	60.590000		hair color, and skin color.
61.440000	62.460000		**Furthermore**^[hơn nữa],
62.450000	65.790000		damaged DNA can sometimes be passed on as well.
66.700000	70.350000		The damaged DNA can eventually lead to gene changes,
70.420000	73.080000		which then may **result in**^[gây ra] a problem in the body.
74.100000	75.300000		Over time,
75.230000	77.300000		the problem may become a disease
77.350000	78.750000		and, sometimes,
78.710000	80.650000		even become **cancerous**^[Cancerous cells are the result of cancer.].

82.140000	84.630000		There are many different types of cancers.
85.200000	88.790000		**Breast cancer**^[ung thư vú] is the most common in the female population,
88.870000	92.830000		while **prostate cancer**^[ưng thư tuyết tiền liệt] is most common in the male population.
93.820000	99.490000		Drinking alcohol increases the chances of developing cancer in different places of the body
99.580000	103.000000		such as the head, neck, **liver**^[gan], or **throat**^[cổ họng].
103.930000	108.620000		**Cigarette smoking**^[việc hút thuốc lá] is the number one cause of lung cancer in the United States.
109.360000	113.250000		Studies also show a strong link between eating too much **sugar**
113.220000	116.890000		and a higher risk of cancerous cells growing even faster.

117.790000	120.620000		Although scientists have been studying cancer,
120.620000	123.510000		there is still no **cure**^[A cure is a medical treatment to make a sickness go away.] for the disease.
124.290000	127.360000		Hopefully, a cure will eventually be found
127.300000	131.420000		and prevent the sadness that comes from **losing**^[lose someone to...: mất ai đó vì...] a loved one to cancer.
