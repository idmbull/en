4.290000	7.700000		One day, a cat climbed a mountain.
7.990000	11.090000		When he reached the **peak**^[The peak is the very top of a mountain.], he met a fox.
11.550000	15.600000		They began talking about how to get away from their enemies.

16.470000	18.370000		"I am very smart.
18.350000	22.410000		I have the **potential**^[Potential means capable of being but not yet actual or real.] to think of **billions**^[A billion is a very large number: 1,000,000,000.] of ideas.
22.510000	23.690000		For instance,
23.880000	27.210000		I can **carve**^[To carve means to cut into something.] a **tiny**^[A tiny thing is very small.] hole in a tree
27.150000	28.700000		and then climb in,"
29.200000	30.590000		the fox said.
31.230000	32.260000		He added,
32.480000	34.530000		"I have a lot of friends.
34.810000	36.350000		If I am in trouble,
36.290000	38.890000		I can call them to **lend**^[To lend something is to give it to someone for a short time.] their help.
39.050000	42.300000		I can escape a whole **army** if I have to!"

43.130000	44.800000		Then, the fox asked,
45.200000	46.830000		"What are your plans?"
47.160000	48.330000		The cat said,
48.990000	50.860000		"I have only one plan.
50.870000	52.120000		Climb a tree."
52.670000	54.060000		The fox said,
54.460000	56.890000		"I hope you have good **fortune**^[Fortune means the things that happen but are not controlled by a person.], then!
57.670000	61.340000		However, one plan does not seem to be **adequate**^[Something adequate is good enough.].
61.530000	63.560000		Do you want me to be your **tutor**^[A tutor is someone who gives lessons to one student.]?
63.830000	67.030000		I can help you develop many new plans."
67.790000	69.060000		The cat said,
69.350000	72.890000		"I **guarantee**^[I will guarantee that the loan will be repaid.] that my plan works every time.
73.450000	75.560000		We can **quit**^[To quit something means to stop doing it.] talking about it."

76.420000	79.550000		Soon, they saw a group of wolves.
79.690000	82.190000		It was clearly an **emergency**^[An emergency is a time when someone needs help right away.]
82.150000	85.120000		and the time to put plans into action
86.150000	89.020000		The cat quickly followed her plan.
89.310000	91.090000		She ran up a tree.
91.310000	95.280000		The fox was so full of **intense**^[An intense thing is very strong.] **anxiety**^[Anxiety is a feeling of worry and fear.]
95.260000	98.470000		that he could not decide which plan to use.
99.330000	101.530000		"What should my **initial**^[Initial shows that something is first.] move be?
101.900000	103.830000		Should I **consult**^[To consult means to ask someone for help.] my friends?"
104.640000	107.620000		All he could do was **spin**^[To spin is to turn around in circles.] in a circle.
108.030000	110.500000		The wolves caught the fox.
110.710000	113.150000		The cat was full of **pride**^[Pride is a feeling of happiness about oneself or one's things.].
113.710000	117.270000		This is **proof**^[Proof is a fact that shows something is real.] that having one good plan
117.220000	120.620000		is better than having many bad plans.
