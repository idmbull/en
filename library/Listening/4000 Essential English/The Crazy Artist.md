4.270000	7.350000		Frenhofer was the best **artist**^[An artist is a person who paints, draws, or makes sculptures.] in the world.
7.560000	9.130000		Everyone loved him.
9.420000	12.470000		The **quality**^[The quality of something is how good it is.] of his paintings was very high.
12.900000	15.890000		He always used the best **materials**^[A material is what is used to make something.].
16.170000	18.990000		He made a big **profit**^[A profit is the extra money you make when you sell something.] from his paintings.
19.310000	22.410000		He had **delicious**^[(bữa ăn) ngon] **meals**^[A meal is a time when food is eaten, such as breakfast, lunch, or dinner.] with his rich **neighbors**.^[A neighbor is a person who lives near you.]
22.600000	24.290000		He **taught**^[teach → taught → taught] art classes.
24.420000	26.100000		Life was good.

27.450000	30.110000		Then his **attitude**^[Someone's attitude is the way they feel and think.] changed.
30.480000	33.320000		He stopped selling paintings and teaching.
33.730000	36.170000		He tried a new **method**^[A method is the way to do something.] of painting.
36.410000	39.560000		He stayed **alone**^[A person who is alone is not with another person.] in his **apartment**^[An apartment is a set of rooms in a building where people live.] all day.
39.720000	42.190000		He worked all day and all night,
42.130000	43.450000		**rarely**^[not very often] eating.
43.710000	46.740000		Soon Frenhofer became very **thin**^[If someone or something is thin, they are not fat.].
47.000000	51.030000		But he kept working on the same painting for many years.
51.190000	53.340000		He worked as hard as he could.

54.620000	57.240000		Finally, he finished the painting.
57.590000	59.240000		He was very happy
59.330000	62.210000		and invited other artists to see it.
63.020000	65.570000		"I want your **professional**^[If something is professional, it deals with work that uses special skills.] opinion,"
65.530000	66.400000		he said.
66.800000	70.960000		He wanted them to **judge**^[đánh giá (To judge something is to say if it is good or bad.)] it and **compare**^[To compare means to say how two things are the same and different.] it to other paintings.
71.520000	76.260000		Everyone was very excited as they went up the **stairs**^[Stairs are the things that are used to walk up or down in a building.] to his apartment.
76.710000	79.590000		Frenhofer was excited to show his painting,
79.770000	82.540000		and the artists were excited to see it.
82.950000	84.370000		"They'll love it,"
84.370000	85.280000		he thought.
85.760000	87.180000		But they did not.

88.150000	90.660000		They were surprised by his painting.
91.080000	93.410000		There was no white anywhere.
93.855086	98.409802		Frenhofer filled the whole painting with lines and colors.
98.740000	101.460000		There was no **space**^[A space is an empty area.] for a normal picture.
101.820000	104.430000		It was full of **strange shapes**^[hình thù lạ lùng].
104.640000	107.300000		It looked bad to the other artists.
107.660000	109.340000		He used **symbols**^[A symbol is a thing that stands for something else.],
109.260000	111.510000		and they didn't understand them.
111.840000	113.860000		They thought it was terrible.
114.590000	117.510000		"Why did you paint this strange picture?”
117.510000	118.650000		someone asked.
118.980000	121.340000		They didn't understand its **beauty**^[Beauty is the state or quality of being beautiful.].

122.580000	124.430000		But after some time,
124.570000	127.490000		many people began to like his painting.
128.020000	131.200000		People wrote **articles**^[An article is a story in a newspaper or magazine.] about it in **magazines**^[A magazine is a regular publication with news, stories, and articles.].
131.430000	133.830000		They said it was his best **work**^[tác phẩm].
134.230000	136.820000		They loved his strange symbols.
137.020000	139.310000		They loved his strange colors.
139.600000	142.360000		Frenhofer's painting reminded everyone
142.440000	144.890000		that just because something was new
144.920000	147.120000		didn't mean that it was bad.
147.450000	150.550000		He also helped them to **realize**^[hiểu ra] that sometimes
150.460000	152.621146		it takes people a little time
152.621146	155.110000		to understand great things.
