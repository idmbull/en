5.430000	9.310000		Do you ever **wonder**^[tự hỏi] where the moon and the sun came from?
9.740000	12.850000		The Inuit people of Alaska have a **theory**^[giả thuyết: A theory is an idea about how something works.].

13.840000	16.870000		They tell a story about a beautiful girl.
17.230000	19.080000		She was very nice.
19.300000	20.680000		In **contrast**^[trái lại: A contrast is a sharp difference between two things.],
20.600000	23.520000		her brother was a **mean little boy**^[cậu nhóc xấu tính].
24.160000	26.860000		One day he **proposed**^[đề xuất, đề nghị: To propose something is to say that it should be done.] something.
27.440000	29.460000		"We should go to a party,"
29.500000	30.410000		he said.
30.850000	32.210000		The girl **accepted**^[To accept something that is offered is to take it.].
32.680000	35.890000		First, it was **necessary**^[If something is necessary, you must do it.] for her to **get ready**^[chuẩn bị].
36.370000	38.150000		She **arranged**^[To arrange things is to put them in the right place.] her hair
38.110000	40.290000		and put on nice clothes.
40.620000	42.950000		This **required**^[To require something is to say that it is necessary.] a lot of time.
43.300000	45.180000		But the girl worked hard,
45.110000	47.270000		and soon she was **satisfied**^[You are satisfied when you have what you wanted.].
47.480000	49.230000		She looked perfect.

50.210000	52.430000		They **attended**^[To attend something is to go to it.] the party together.
52.760000	54.740000		The girl was having fun.
55.150000	57.660000		Later, she walked into the bathroom.
58.060000	59.140000		Suddenly,
59.080000	61.030000		the lights were turned off!
61.330000	63.290000		Someone **grabbed**^[To grab is to take a hold of someone or something suddenly.] her hair
63.230000	65.110000		and **tore**^[xé: To tear something means to pull it apart.] her clothes.
65.410000	67.610000		She ran out of the bathroom.
67.890000	71.070000		She wanted to know who did this to her.

72.160000	73.990000		Then she had an idea.
74.330000	76.310000		She **fixed**^[sửa] her hair again.
76.580000	79.900000		This time it was even more beautiful.
80.120000	83.500000		She even arranged beautiful **jewels**^[trang sức, đá quý] in it.
83.760000	87.500000		She wanted to **encourage**^[To encourage people is to make them want to do something.] the person to grab it again.
87.760000	90.390000		She put black **dirt**^[đất, bụi bẩn] in her hair.
90.680000	94.090000		The **purpose**^[A purpose is the reason that you do something.] of this was to catch the person.

95.150000	97.240000		She went to the bathroom again,
97.370000	99.440000		and it was the same **pattern**^[A pattern is a way in which something is done or organized.].
99.750000	101.220000		The lights went off,
101.200000	103.360000		and someone grabbed her hair.
103.790000	105.170000		When he **released**^[To release something is to stop holding it.] it,
105.230000	106.920000		his hand was black.
107.510000	109.790000		The girl returned to the party.
110.130000	114.200000		She knew there was only a **single**^[If something is single, then there is only one.] person with a black hand.
114.530000	116.400000		When she saw that person,
116.450000	118.190000		he was very **familiar**^[quen thuộc (People or things familiar to you are those you know well.)].
118.470000	119.970000		It was her brother!

121.070000	123.000000		He ran into the woods.
123.190000	125.170000		The girl ran after him.
125.560000	128.970000		They both carried fire so they could see in the dark.
129.410000	131.780000		The smoke went into the air.
132.130000	134.540000		As they ran, they grew.
134.720000	136.530000		They became **huge**^[If something is huge, it is very big.].
136.650000	139.360000		Then they went into space.
139.640000	141.790000		When the girl's fire went out,
141.790000	143.590000		she **hung**^[To hang something is to keep it above the ground.] in the sky.
143.860000	145.740000		She became the moon,
145.880000	148.290000		and her brother became the sun.
148.530000	150.920000		They **chase**^[You chase people when you run after them and try to catch them.] each other forever.
