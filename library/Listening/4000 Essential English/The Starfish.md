3.850000	7.120000		Last summer I took a trip to an **island**^[An island is land in the middle of water.].
7.310000	9.050000		I had a lot of fun.
9.340000	13.340000		I sat and watched the **waves**^[A wave is a line of water that moves higher than the rest of the water.] and listened to the ocean.
13.780000	16.420000		I learned to **identify**^[To identify something is to find out what it is.] birds.
16.810000	19.110000		I **discovered**^[To discover something is to find it for the first time.] pretty things
19.030000	21.870000		and enjoyed the **taste**^[A taste is the flavor something makes in your mouth.] of new foods.
21.930000	23.950000		It was a very nice time.

24.930000	26.140000		One evening
26.050000	28.650000		I took a **pleasant**^[If something is pleasant, you enjoy it.] walk by the ocean.
29.020000	30.720000		When the **waves**^[A wave is a line of water that moves higher than the rest of the water.] came in,
30.700000	33.530000		many **starfish**^[an animal shaped like a star that lives in the water] fell on the **beach**^[The beach is a sandy or rocky place by the ocean.].
33.880000	36.950000		Some starfish went back into the water,
36.900000	38.290000		and they were safe.
38.580000	41.940000		But other starfish were **still**^[Still is used when you say that a situation keeps going on.] on the sand.
42.310000	45.650000		They would die if they did not get into the water.
46.560000	50.050000		There were many starfish on the beach that night.
50.240000	51.880000		It made me sad,
51.850000	54.720000		but I knew I could not **fix**^[To fix something is to make it work.] the problem.
55.460000	59.620000		I **stepped**^[To step is to walk.] very carefully so I did not **damage**^[To damage something is to break it.] them.

60.450000	62.610000		Then I saw a little girl.
63.070000	66.070000		She was also sad about the starfish.
66.480000	69.870000		She wanted to **prevent**^[To prevent something is to stop it from happening.] all of them from dying.
70.340000	73.050000		She asked me if I could **perhaps**^[Perhaps is used when you say that something could happen.] help her.

74.030000	76.510000		"I don't think we can do anything,"
76.720000	77.720000		I said.
78.270000	80.780000		The little girl started to cry.
81.260000	85.400000		She sat back **against**^[To be against something is to be touching it or opposed to it.] a **rock**^[A rock is a hard thing in the dirt.] and thought for a while.
85.660000	86.670000		Finally,
86.730000	88.370000		the **emotion**^[An emotion is how you feel.] was gone.
88.760000	91.320000		She stopped crying and stood up.
91.760000	94.340000		Then she picked up a starfish
94.250000	96.240000		and **threw**^[To throw something is to use your hand to make it go through the air.] it into the water.

97.170000	98.580000		"What are you doing?"
98.980000	100.040000		I asked her.
100.400000	102.610000		But she did not answer me.
102.870000	106.520000		She just threw as many starfish as she could.
107.530000	109.540000		"You cannot **save**^[To save something is to keep it from being hurt.] all of them!"
109.750000	110.760000		I said.

111.250000	113.110000		She stopped to look at me.
113.370000	116.100000		“No, I cannot save them all,”
116.280000	117.590000		she replied.
117.780000	121.580000		Then she picked up a very big starfish and said,
121.860000	124.200000		"But I can save this one."
124.780000	126.620000		And then she **smiled**^[To smile is to show happiness with your mouth.]
126.540000	131.030000		and threw the starfish as far as she could into the **ocean**^[The ocean is all of the salt water that surrounds land.].
