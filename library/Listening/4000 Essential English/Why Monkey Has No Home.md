4.280000	7.030000		For five years, there was a **famine**^[nạn đói].
7.370000	12.060000		The farmers asked people to **bless**^[To bless is to ask God for protection or help.] them, and finally they had a good **harvest**^[A harvest is the act of collecting food from farming.].
12.650000	14.970000		Since there was now plenty of food,
15.000000	17.280000		the pharaoh decided to have a party.
17.730000	19.750000		The party was a happy **affair**^[trang trọng hơn event].
20.290000	21.640000		For five days,
21.550000	23.350000		they had a huge **feast**^[đại tiệc].

24.070000	26.070000		Monkey was very happy.
26.550000	29.570000		Because of the famine, he was very slim.
30.110000	32.220000		He wanted to eat a lot of food.
32.870000	37.520000		When he arrived at the feast hundreds of long tables were filled with food.
38.130000	41.880000		There were nuts, bowls of **cereal**^[ngũ cốc], and **ripe fruit**^[trái cây chín].
42.480000	46.290000		He could also smell hot **roasted** meat cooking on the **stove**.

47.560000	50.040000		The **assembly**^[An assembly is a group gathered together for the same reason.] of animals was **merry**^[vui rộn ràng (thường dịp lễ) (Merry Christmas)].
50.530000	52.770000		However, during the meal,
52.720000	56.380000		Monkey thought of a **scheme**^[âm mưu] to **exploit**^[lợi dụng] the pharaoh's kindness.
56.970000	59.320000		He decided to steal some of the food
59.260000	61.110000		and then eat it at home.

62.040000	64.140000		All the animals were **cheerful**^[vui vẻ, tích cực (tính cách/không khí)].
64.590000	67.680000		They didn't notice that Monkey was hiding food.
68.700000	72.760000		After the feast, Monkey took the food to his house and ate it.
73.290000	77.100000		He repeated this routine every day for four days.

77.990000	81.570000		But on the fifth day, the pharaoh had a surprise.
82.060000	84.810000		He was going to give all the animals a home.
85.370000	87.500000		Monkey was very excited.
88.080000	90.590000		But when he arrived at the pharaoh's home,
90.630000	92.520000		he could not get through the door.
93.400000	97.050000		The **diameter**^[đường kính] of his **waist**^[vòng eo] was wider than the door.
97.360000	98.980000		He was too fat!

99.650000	103.080000		Monkey asked the pharaoh to **forgive**^[tha thứ] him for his theft.
103.460000	105.440000		But the pharaoh said no.

106.260000	107.260000		"**Pardon**^[xin tha thứ]?"
107.480000	108.810000		asked the monkey.
109.260000	112.810000		He didn't understand why the pharaoh was being unkind.
114.000000	116.410000		"Everybody else will have a home now,
116.320000	117.720000		but not you.
118.300000	121.280000		Now you know that **greed**^[sự tham lam] gets you nothing,"
121.490000	123.070000		explained the pharaoh.
