4.130000	10.960000		The **distinct**^[A distinct thing is different or stands out.] history of the famous Great Pyramids has been studied for many years by people who study **archaeology**^[khảo cổ học].
11.530000	15.120000		The pyramids were built nearly 5,000 years ago!

15.750000	17.950000		According to ancient Egyptians,
17.960000	21.480000		kings **played an important role**^[đóng vai trò quan trọng] in the building of the pyramids.
22.220000	25.710000		Egyptians believed that kings were chosen by the gods
25.730000	27.710000		and that, when a king died,
27.740000	31.360000		he went on to become the god of the dead in the **afterlife**^[The afterlife is a life that some people believe begins when a person dies.].
32.210000	34.440000		Gold, food, and clothes
34.350000	36.071524		were buried with the body

40.190000	45.010000		The **royal family**^[gia đình hoàng tộc] and other **elite individuals**^[cá nhân ưu tứ] were also buried near the king.

61.770000	66.650000		The Great Pyramid is made of over 2.5 million stone blocks;
67.110000	70.630000		the base alone covers an area of thirteen **acres**^[mẫu Anh (đơn vị đo diện tích ≈ 4.047 m²)].

75.360000	80.300000		The visible core of the Great Pyramid was originally covered by smooth casing stones.
81.310000	85.910000		Some of the casing stones that cover the **surface**^[The surface is the top layer of something.] can still be seen at the base.
86.590000	90.750000		The stones were **laid**^[xếp chồng] so well that there is not a single gap between them.

96.230000	100.670000		which then divides into a **corridor**^[Hành lang (lối đi dài trong nhà, hai bên là tường).] going up and another going down.
101.390000	104.520000		The rising corridor goes up to the Queen's **Chamber**^[Mang sắc thái cổ xưa, trang trọng hoặc bí mật. (room)],
104.520000	107.150000		the Grand **Gallery**^[Thông thường nghĩa là "Phòng trưng bày nghệ thuật". Tuy nhiên, trong kiến trúc, Gallery còn có nghĩa là một hành lang dài và hẹp, thường có trần cao.], and the King's Chamber.
