3.660000	5.680000		My name is Albert Einstein.
5.820000	9.050000		Many people know about the great things I've **accomplished**^[To accomplish something means to finish it.].
9.380000	13.360000		But I had many **barriers**^[A barrier is something that blocks a path or way.] to get through before I became famous.

14.130000	15.690000		I was born in Germany.
15.890000	20.620000		When I was in **elementary school**^[trường tiểu học (cấp học đầu tiêu trong hệ thống giáo dục); primary school (UK)], I already knew about math and **statistics**^[A statistic is a number that tells a fact about something.].
20.950000	22.260000		When I was a boy,
22.210000	24.690000		I **pretended**^[To pretend means to make believe something is real.] to be a great scientist.
25.030000	26.370000		I loved school,
26.440000	28.720000		but my life at home was hard.
29.080000	31.080000		My father lost his job,
31.090000	33.520000		so my family lived in **poverty**^[Poverty is the state of being poor.].
33.800000	36.070000		We could not pay the **rent**^[Rent is the money people pay to live in a certain place.] in Germany.
36.420000	38.890000		We became **immigrants**^[An immigrant is a person who moves to a different country.] and went to Italy.
39.160000	42.510000		I finished high school and went to college in Switzerland.

43.450000	44.620000		After college,
44.590000	46.610000		I began writing about science.
46.860000	49.470000		I did not reach success in an **instant**^[An instant is a very short amount of time.], though.
49.880000	53.670000		At first, other scientists did not **approve**^[To approve of something means you like or agree with that thing.] of my work.
54.040000	55.740000		They thought I was a **failure**^[A failure happens when something is not done right.].
56.150000	60.390000		Rising to the **rank**^[A rank is a person's place in an order of people.] of an **admired scientist**^[nhà khoa học được ngưỡng mộ] was a **gradual**^[Something gradual happens slowly.] process.
60.620000	63.890000		Soon, people started to notice that I was right.
64.150000	67.360000		At last, I began to get some **recognition**^[Recognition is the act of getting praise from other people.].

68.220000	73.290000		I showed how to find the **approximate**^[Approximate means close to an exact amount, number, or time.] size of very big things, like stars.
73.570000	77.600000		I also **detected**^[To detect means to notice or find something.] and explained the motion of very small things,
77.540000	78.700000		like atoms.
79.020000	80.180000		And for fun,
80.160000	84.290000		I made a machine that could **refrigerate**^[To refrigerate something means to make it cold.] food by **inserting**^[To insert something means to put it in something else.] heat.
84.790000	86.180000		I never **retired**^[To retire is to leave a job, usually because of old age.].
86.390000	88.810000		I felt it was my **duty**^[A duty is something that a person has to do.] to keep working.
