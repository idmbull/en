3.400000	6.750000		Ricky the rabbit and Tera the turtle
6.710000	8.710000		met by the **edge**^[The edge is the furthest part or side of something.] of the river.
9.420000	12.690000		"No one is **capable**^[A capable person or thing can do an action.] of beating me in a race!"
12.780000	13.930000		Ricky said.
14.120000	15.550000		He was **confident**^[Confident people believe that they can do something without failing.] -
15.570000	17.550000		his smile **conveyed**^[To convey is to communicate or make ideas known.] that.

18.270000	19.990000		"I can beat you,”
20.150000	21.300000		Tera said.

21.790000	24.050000		Ricky laughed with **delight**^[Delight is a feeling of being very happy with something.].

24.670000	25.730000		Tera said,
26.110000	28.240000		"We will race tomorrow.
28.480000	30.020000		The **destination**^[A destination is the place where someone or something is going.]
29.950000	31.380000		is the hill."

32.270616	33.640616		Ricky agreed.
34.100000	37.160000		Tera **concentrated**^[To concentrate is to give one's full attention to something.] on winning the race.
37.510000	40.020000		She was not faster than Ricky.
40.450000	43.550000		She needed a **definite**^[A definite thing is certain or sure to be true.] way to **succeed**^[To succeed is to complete something as planned.].
44.130000	46.910000		She told her family about the race:
47.590000	51.820000		"I have **concluded**^[To conclude is to arrive at a logical end by looking at evidence.] that I have to **resort**^[To resort to something is to depend on it in order to solve a problem.] to something bad.
52.130000	53.590000		I will **cheat**^[To cheat is to be dishonest in order to win or do well.]."
54.410000	57.350000		She quietly told her **instructions**^[A set of instructions explains how to do something.] to them.
57.850000	61.070000		Her family members all looked very similar!

61.940000	64.410000		They hid in the **shadows**^[A shadow is the dark area that is made when something blocks light.] on the **path**^[A path is a way from one place to another that people can walk along.].
64.810000	66.400000		The race began.
66.790000	69.330000		Tera was soon far behind.
69.670000	74.600000		However, Tera's brother hid behind a **bush**^[A bush is a woody plant that is smaller than a tree.] in the **valley**^[A valley is a low area of land between two mountains or hills.] below.
75.270000	77.160000		When Ricky got close,
77.300000	79.740000		Tera's brother began to run.
80.140000	82.310000		He looked just like Tera!
82.830000	86.290000		Ricky ran as fast as he could along the path.
86.850000	88.120000		But, to him,
88.170000	91.370000		it seemed like Tera was always ahead.
91.790000	95.280000		Ricky had used a **considerable**^[Considerable means large in size, amount, or extent.] amount of energy.

95.940000	97.480000		He reached the top,
97.650000	100.320000		but Tera's sister was already there.
101.030000	103.040000		"Well, you win,
103.160000	104.380000		Ricky said.

105.480000	109.550000		Later, Tera had a **broad**^[Broad means that something is wide, not narrow.] smile on her face.
109.800000	111.860000		Ricky never **suspected**^[To suspect something is to believe that it might be true.].
112.230000	113.670000		He had been cheated
113.590000	116.250000		by a family of slow turtles.
