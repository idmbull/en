3.640000	7.750000		A town was fighting for their independence from another country.
8.070000	11.010000		Several **rebels**^[A rebel is a person who fights the government in order to change it.] started a **revolution**^[cuộc cách mạng].
11.470000	15.670000		However, they were afraid of an **invasion**^[cuộc xâm lược] from a lot of **troops**^[Troops are soldiers that fight in groups in a battle.].
15.960000	19.070000		They didn't have enough **warriors**^[chiến binh] to stop the enemy,
19.290000	21.590000		so they asked a knight for help.

22.050000	23.790000		The knight made a plan.
24.110000	26.830000		A tall mountain was outside the town.
27.060000	29.810000		The road near the top was very narrow.
29.930000	32.400000		**Cliffs**^[A cliff is a high and often flat wall of rock.] rose on both sides of it.

33.180000	35.160000		"We must trick the enemy.
35.350000	37.830000		They have to follow us up the mountain,"
38.000000	39.380000		the knight explained.
39.640000	41.130000		"On the narrow path,
41.190000	44.550000		only a few can attack us at one time."

45.320000	47.980000		The people agreed with the knight's plan.

48.160000	50.140000		The knight put on his **armor**^[áo giáp],
50.160000	52.600000		and the warriors got their **spears**^[cây giáo].
52.830000	54.380000		When the enemy attacked,
54.450000	57.830000		the knight and warriors acted as if they were afraid.
58.200000	61.080000		They quickly **withdrew**^[rút lui] toward the mountain.
61.300000	64.470000		The enemy troops followed them up the **steep**^[A steep surface or place has a slope or angle that rises or falls sharply.] path.
64.770000	67.270000		Soon, the enemy became tired.

67.770000	68.910000		At the **summit**^[A summit is the highest part of a hill or mountain.],
68.870000	71.310000		the knight and his troops stopped.
71.610000	73.880000		The enemy was close behind them.
73.940000	75.730000		But now they were tired.
76.080000	80.710000		Also, only a few could attack because the path was narrow.
81.300000	84.100000		The knight and the warriors fought the enemy.
84.360000	86.540000		But there were too many troops.
86.740000	88.390000		The knight was afraid.
89.360000	92.320000		If the warriors **yielded**^[nhường, đầu hàng] the path to the enemy,
92.360000	94.110000		the town would be lost.
94.510000	97.560000		A storm suddenly came over the mountain.
97.850000	100.300000		There was strong wind and rain.
100.390000	102.130000		**Thunder**^[sấm sét] **boomed**^[rền vang].
102.400000	105.380000		**Lightning**^[tia sét] **struck**^[đánh] some trees near the enemy.
105.670000	107.680000		The trees **blazed**^[To blaze means to burn brightly or powerfully.].
107.860000	110.160000		The **flames**^[ngọn lửa] scared the enemy,
110.350000	111.780000		and they **retreated**^[To retreat means to run away because of losing a fight.].
112.000000	113.760000		They ran down the mountain,
113.690000	114.980000		out of the town,
114.910000	116.470000		and never returned.
116.840000	118.250000		The knight explained,
118.580000	119.850000		"With a little luck,
119.880000	123.030000		a good plan beats even a big army."
