3.670000	5.990000		Simon Yates was a **lawyer**^[A lawyer works with the law and represents people in court.].
6.210000	7.940000		He helped many people.
8.020000	10.980000		**However**^[However means despite or not being influenced by something.], he was not a nice man.
11.370000	14.970000		His **policy**^[A policy is a rule.] was to help only rich people.
15.370000	18.610000		He didn't **bother**^[To bother is to make the effort to do something.] about **social**^[If something is social, it is about many people in a community.] **injustice**^[Injustice is a lack of fairness or justice.].
18.920000	20.850000		He made a lot of money,
20.910000	23.550000		but many people didn't like him.
23.810000	27.290000		Even people on his **staff**^[A staff is a group of people working together in a company.] didn't like him.
27.580000	28.750000		In fact,
28.740000	31.450000		they were **glad**^[If you are glad, you are happy.] when he **got into trouble**^[gặp rắc rồi].

32.620000	35.550000		Simon had a very bad day.
35.980000	39.830000		He did many things wrong and **lost his job**^[mất việc].
40.040000	40.970000		Soon,
41.050000	42.720000		he didn't have any money.
43.280000	47.960000		His wife, Mrs. Yates, began to have **doubts**^[Doubt is a feeling of not being sure.] about him.
48.780000	51.660000		Simon wanted to start a new life.
52.060000	54.220000		He planned to leave the country.

55.280000	58.300000		He **mentioned**^[To mention something is to talk about it.] his plan to the **captain**^[A captain is the person who controls a ship or airplane.] of a ship.
58.490000	61.170000		The captain was **exploring**^[To explore is to look for new places.] the world.
61.850000	64.960000		The captain **felt bad for**^[cảm thấy thương, ám náy, tội nghiệp cho ai đó] Simon and said,
65.480000	68.060000		"I will take you to foreign countries."
68.580000	70.470000		They left the next day.

71.220000	74.740000		Near the **conclusion**^[The conclusion of something is the final part of it.] of their **international**^[If something is international, it involves more than one country.] trip,
74.800000	76.710000		the weather turned bad.
77.080000	79.970000		A wave pushed Simon off the boat.
80.120000	81.590000		But he was **alive**^[Someone or something that is alive is not dead.].
82.150000	84.430000		He swam **toward**^[If you go toward something, you go closer to it.] an island.
84.850000	87.410000		After a long time he got there.

87.790000	90.070000		At first he was **upset**^[cảm giác thất vọng khi có chuyện không tốt đến với mình].
90.190000	92.520000		He was **lost**^[bị lạc] and alone.
93.410000	95.470000		"I'll never go home again,"
95.720000	96.730000		he thought.
97.460000	101.980000		He had a lot of problems, but he didn't die.
102.290000	104.640000		He built a house in a tree.
104.830000	107.240000		He lived on a diet of fish.
107.430000	110.650000		He made tools from **wood**^[Wood is the thing that trees are made of.] and **bones**^[A bone is a hard part of the body.].
110.950000	113.600000		He made a cup to drink rainwater.

114.700000	115.840000		Slowly,
115.870000	118.740000		he learned to be happy on the island.
119.140000	121.190000		He swam every day.
121.460000	123.670000		He had trouble sometimes,
123.620000	127.150000		but he always found a way to fix the problem.
128.100000	129.620000		Life was simple.
129.720000	130.990000		He liked it.

132.200000	133.220000		Finally,
133.230000	136.830000		people on a ship saw Simon on the island.
137.030000	139.270000		They wanted to take him home.
139.620000	141.540000		But Simon was happy.
141.880000	144.850000		He gave them a long **speech**^[A speech is something said to a group of people.] about life.
144.990000	147.170000		He said he wanted to stay.
147.330000	150.140000		He liked his new, simple life
150.130000	152.240000		more than his **old** life.
