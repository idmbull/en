3.460000	7.700000		I first met 8-year-old Katy on a rainy afternoon.
7.940000	10.010000		I was a **nurse** at a hospital.
10.410000	13.520000		The **clerk**^[A clerk is a type of worker. Clerks in a store help customers.] at the desk told me about Katy.
13.800000	16.890000		She was there because she felt a lot of **pain**^[Pain is the feeling that you have when you are hurt.].
17.390000	21.270000		The doctors **located**^[To locate something is to find it.] a problem at the **base**^[The base is the bottom of something.] of her **brain**^[The brain is the organ in your head that lets you think.].
21.850000	23.760000		I knew she was special
23.670000	25.800000		even before she **got better**^[hồi phục, khá lên].
26.380000	29.730000		I'll always remember Katy as a hero.

30.810000	32.810000		When I **entered**^[To enter a place is to go into it.] Katy's room,
32.800000	34.730000		she was not in her bed.
34.840000	37.250000		She was in a chair next to Tommy,
37.220000	38.410000		a little boy.
39.220000	41.610000		**Though**^[Though is used when one idea makes another seem surprising.] Katy did not feel well,
41.630000	44.620000		she was playing with Tommy and his toys.
44.820000	48.970000		It took a lot of **effort**^[Effort is hard work or an attempt to do something.] for her just to sit in the chair.
49.110000	53.540000		But she played with Tommy because it made him happy.

53.700000	56.430000		Katy was always smiling
56.380000	59.000000		and never **appeared**^[To appear is to seem.] to be in pain.
59.510000	62.490000		She **refused**^[To refuse something is to say "no" to it.] to just **lie in bed**^[nằm trên giường].
62.860000	63.980000		One day,
63.940000	66.050000		I found her painting a picture.
66.240000	69.790000		Later, she gave it to one of the older patients.
70.050000	71.180000		Another day,
71.130000	75.920000		she went outside to get flowers for another sick little girl.
76.550000	79.160000		Katy made everyone smile.

79.980000	83.830000		The doctors **hurried**^[To hurry is to do something quickly.] to fix the problem in Katy's brain.
84.250000	86.540000		The **operation**^[An operation is when a doctor replaces or removes something in the body.] was successful!
86.980000	90.840000		The doctors **informed**^[To inform someone is to tell them about something.] the hospital staff of the good news.
90.930000	92.620000		Katy was fine.
92.970000	95.180000		She soon felt **excellent**^[When something is excellent, it is very good.].
95.500000	96.770000		She got better
96.690000	100.000000		and was able to **leave**^[To leave means to go away from someone or something.] the hospital a month **later**^[Later means after the present, expected, or usual time.].

101.170000	104.060000		I have had a long **career**^[A career is a job that you do for a large part of your life.] as a nurse.
104.280000	106.180000		I have met many patients.
106.290000	110.420000		However, I have never met another girl like Katy.
111.100000	113.280000		Even after she got well,
113.310000	115.420000		she still came to the hospital.
115.720000	119.150000		She played **various**^[If something is various, there are many types of it.] games with the young patients.
119.300000	122.450000		She read many books to the older patients.
122.774244	124.774244		Katy's kind heart
124.800000	127.240000		helped her get better so quickly.
127.630000	132.160000		She is a hero to me and everyone else at the hospital.
