4.390000	7.230000		Jeremy was from a family of **miners**^[thợ mỏ].
7.290000	10.940000		Like them, he worked **underground** during the day.
11.200000	14.650000		His job was to find **raw**^[A raw material is natural and has not been processed.] **minerals**^[khoáng sản] and **jewels**^[đá quý].
15.030000	16.810000		Each night after work,
16.770000	19.560000		he **lay awake**^[thao thức] in an open field.
19.860000	23.030000		With his **telescope**^[kính thiên văn], he looked at the stars.
23.220000	26.290000		He was amazed by the **scale**^[The scale of something is its size, especially when it is very large.] of space.
26.460000	29.660000		He wished someday he might travel there.

30.640000	31.700000		One day,
31.670000	33.900000		there was an **accident**^[tai nạn] in the **mine**^[hầm mỏ].
34.120000	36.470000		Water **poured**^[To pour a liquid means to make it come out of a container.] into the mine.
36.750000	38.490000		Everything was dark.
38.850000	42.430000		Jeremy **stretched**^[To stretch is to make your arms or legs reach out.] out and grabbed a piece of wood.
42.610000	44.380000		It kept him from sinking.
44.970000	46.440000		For a long time,
46.420000	48.510000		he **floated**^[To float is to move on top of water without sinking.] in silence.
48.710000	50.680000		Then, he heard voices.
50.960000	53.910000		The other miners were coming to rescue him.

54.890000	59.660000		This accident made Jeremy think about his job and his life.
60.080000	61.200000		The next day,
61.210000	62.620000		he **skipped work**^[nghỉ làm]
62.550000	64.880000		and made a very important decision.
65.330000	68.450000		He had the **courage**^[Courage is the feeling of not being afraid.] to follow his decision.
68.870000	71.620000		He decided to become an **astronaut**^[phi hành gia].
71.940000	73.910000		For the next two years,
73.860000	76.670000		Jeremy studied and trained hard.
76.920000	78.780000		He completed his training,
78.810000	79.880000		and one day,
79.850000	83.990000		he was given **permission**^[Permission means the act of allowing some action.] to **participate**^[To participate is to be active and do something.] in a journey to space.
84.300000	86.510000		His wish had been **granted**^[To grant something is to allow someone to have it.].

87.340000	89.760000		His spaceship left the ground.
89.890000	93.260000		It went higher until there was no more **gravity**^[trọng lực].
93.680000	97.080000		Part of his job was to send out a **satellite**^[vệ tinh]
96.990000	99.940000		that would then float away from the spaceship.
100.050000	103.850000		Now, instead of just looking at the stars,
103.900000	107.090000		Jeremy could look at the Earth as well.
