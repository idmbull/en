4.447068	6.127068		**Across**^[khắp, xuyên suốt] the world,
6.000000	11.470000		places are increasing their efforts to **recycle**^[phục hồi] and **help the environment**^[bảo vệ môi trường (tái chế, giảm rác, nâng cao ý thức…)].
11.850000	16.300000		Recycling is when trash is **reused**^[tái sử dụng] and not **thrown away**^[vứt bỏ].
16.770000	18.240000		In recent **history**^[History is the study of the past.],
18.200000	22.240000		more and more **cities**^[A city is a place where a lot of people live.] and **countries**^[A country is an area of land with the same government and laws.] have started recycling.
23.200000	30.840000		These places have **developed**^[To develop is to make something larger or more advanced.] their recycling programs to stop^[stop … from: ngăn chặn] our Earth from being covered with trash
30.770000	32.860000		and **black**^[Black is the darkest color.], dirty air.

33.860000	38.790000		According to the **Environmental Protection Agency**^[cơ quan Bảo vệ Môi trường] in the United States,
38.760000	41.780000		recycling also helps **save energy**^[tiết kiệm năng lượng].
42.040000	47.270000		The agency encourages the recycling of **glass**^[Glass is a transparent, breakable material.] and **plastic**^[Plastic is a material made by people.] bottles,
47.190000	49.960000		paper, and **aluminum cans**^[lon nhôm].
50.810000	55.500000		Many European countries have strong recycling programs as well.
55.890000	61.220000		Austria, Germany, and **Norway**^[Na Uy] are well known for being leaders in recycling,
61.440000	66.630000		and South Korea and Wales are countries that have a lot of recycling as well.

67.510000	72.200000		There are many reasons why some countries recycle more than others.
72.520000	76.540000		The **fact**^[A fact is a piece of information that is true.] is that these governments **support**^[ủng hộ] recycling,
76.740000	79.260000		and they are **aware**^[If someone is aware, they know that something or a situation exists.] of its importance.
79.630000	82.880000		There is also a lot of money spent on recycling.
83.150000	90.690000		However, it is also necessary for **people**^[People are humans.] to **try hard**^[cố gắng tối đa] to recycle what they can from their own homes.

91.440000	95.230000		Other ways to **fight**^[chống lại] the **waste**^[rác thải] **problem**^[A problem is a situation when something goes wrong.] also exist.
95.450000	99.340000		Many cities **place**^[đặt] recycling bins on their **streets**^[A street is a road in a city or village.].
99.540000	102.830000		There are recycling projects across some cities
102.830000	107.630000		— and in these projects, companies **advertise**^[To advertise is to describe or draw attention to a product or event by using a public medium.] the need to recycle.
107.940000	110.960000		This helps keep the city streets **clean**^[To clean is to make something neat and tidy.].

111.950000	116.260000		**Electric**^[If something is electric, it uses electricity.] cars are another way to keep the environment clean.
116.560000	119.280000		The motors of these cars are electric.
119.440000	123.150000		They **get**^[nhận] their power from **electricity**^[điện năng] and **batteries**^[A battery is an object placed inside something to supply it with electricity.]
123.070000	125.000000		**rather than**^[thay vì, chứ không phải (Hai vế phải song song về mặt ngữ pháp)] from gas.

125.800000	131.480000		The hope is that **eventually** all cities in all countries will recycle
131.400000	134.240000		and make our Earth a cleaner place.
135.120000	137.170000		We must protect **nature**
137.110000	140.310000		and **never** stop thinking about how to protect it.
140.930000	145.890000		So **think** before you throw away something that can be recycled!
