3.630000	5.320000		A long time ago,
5.450000	9.440000		Blackbeard was one of the most **violent**^[A violent person or animal uses force to hurt others.] **pirates**^[cướp biển] ever.
9.710000	12.560000		He was also an **enormous**^[Enormous people or things are very large.] man.

13.640000	17.360000		One day, there was a thick **fog**^[Fog is a thick cloud that is near the ground or water.] over the water.
17.830000	20.870000		Blackbeard did an **extraordinary**^[Extraordinary things are amazing.] thing.
21.370000	23.330000		With his **sword**^[A sword is a long sharp weapon.] in his belt,
23.460000	26.740000		he attacked several **giant**^[Giant means very big.] ships near a town
26.780000	29.660000		and took some of the town's **citizens**^[A citizen is someone who lives in a certain place.].
30.160000	33.100000		Then, he **revealed**^[To reveal is to show something.] his **intentions**^[An intention is what a person plans to do.].
33.500000	34.650000		He **declared**^[To declare is to say something officially.]:
35.460000	37.580000		"You will give me medicine!"
38.290000	42.940000		Blackbeard wanted the medicine for some of the sick pirates on his ship.

43.520000	46.280000		The people had a bad **impression**^[An impression is the way of thinking about someone or something.] of him.
46.590000	49.100000		They were **mad**^[A mad person or animal is angry.], and they **resisted**^[To resist something is to fight against it.].
49.470000	51.250000		But they were **trapped**.
51.500000	53.510000		They wanted to get **rid**^[To rid is to make a place free from something or someone.] of him.
53.920000	57.660000		So the town's **council**^[A council is a group of people who run a city or town.] decided to give him the medicine.

58.560000	59.810000		After this,
59.810000	62.680000		there was a reward for catching Blackbeard.
63.210000	65.150000		If Blackbeard was caught,
65.290000	66.840000		he would have a **trial**^[A trial is the way a court discovers if a person is guilty or innocent.].
67.330000	69.330000		He didn't want to go to jail,
69.590000	71.910000		so he quit being a pirate.

72.630000	74.950000		Blackbeard became a fisherman.
75.570000	78.010000		But he **ought**^[If you ought to do an action, it is the right thing to do.] to have stayed on land.
78.350000	81.190000		The Royal Navy was still looking for him.
81.590000	84.750000		They attacked him while he was fishing on his boat.
85.350000	87.990000		Blackbeard fought as hard as he could,
88.090000	89.270000		but finally,
89.330000	90.470000		he was killed.
90.820000	93.000000		He didn't even get a **funeral**^[A funeral is a ceremony that takes place after a person dies.].
93.350000	96.320614		But people still tell **tales**^[A tale is a story.] about him
96.239004	97.910000		many years later.
