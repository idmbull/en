3.570000	5.745989		A long time ago in Alaska,
5.679944	8.890000		a dog named Patsy Ann watched the **horizon**^[đường chân trời].
9.350000	14.180000		Every day, she waited by the bay for ships returning from an **expedition**^[An expedition is a long trip, usually to a place very far away.].

14.760000	16.874716		Patsy Ann was a **brilliant**^[A brilliant person is very bright or smart.] dog,
16.825182	18.670000		and she was very unique.
18.930000	20.300000		She was **deaf**^[điếc].
20.680000	22.680000		She couldn't bark, either.
23.600000	27.720000		But she used all of her other senses to know when a ship was near.

28.490000	30.730000		Patsy Ann lived on the streets.
31.090000	34.420000		Her owners did not want her because she could not hear,
34.280000	35.860000		so they **abandoned**^[bỏ rơi] her.
36.410000	39.030000		She found **refuge**^[A refuge is a place of safety.] in a fancy hotel.
39.720000	42.620000		Guests **rubbed**^[xoa] her back and **scratched her chin**^[gãi cằm nó].
42.930000	45.000000		Many people gave her food.
45.180000	47.270000		She became quite overweight.

48.310000	50.420000		She became very famous.
50.770000	54.250000		Visitors to Alaska were **enthusiastic**^[An enthusiastic person is excited by or interested in something.] about meeting her.
54.820000	56.700000		They brought presents for her.
56.930000	60.060000		They liked seeing her, and the feeling was **mutual**^[A mutual thing is felt in the same way by two or more people.].
60.560000	63.980000		The **mayor**^[thị trưởng] said Patsy Ann should be called the town's greeter.

64.620000	67.440000		The people in town loved Patsy Ann, too,
67.320000	69.480000		even though she lived on the streets.
69.870000	72.230000		They were willing to fight to keep her.
72.890000	76.770000		A new law made all dogs wear a collar and **get shots**^[tiêm phòng].
77.650000	80.010000		The mayor received many **complaints**^[A complaint is an expression of unhappiness about something.].
80.230000	83.200000		People wanted Patsy Ann to be able to stay.
83.650000	86.480000		One **ambitious**^[An ambitious person wants to be rich or successful.] sailor got people to help.
86.820000	90.840000		Together, they paid for Patsy Ann to go to the **veterinarian**^[bác sĩ thú y].
91.140000	93.520000		She got her shots and a collar.
93.520000	94.960000		She could stay.

95.730000	97.450000		When Patsy Ann died,
97.350000	99.800000		everyone missed the town's **loyal**^[Loyal people always help or support a certain person or thing.] greeter.
100.190000	103.820000		So the mayor hired someone to make a statue of Patsy Ann.
104.350000	106.440000		He restored the town's greeter.
107.060000	110.081929		Now, she stands near the water forever,
110.048907	112.160000		waiting for ships to come home.
