4.440000	6.330000		This is a true story.
6.540000	9.020000		It happened long ago in Greece.

10.180000	11.780000		"We must fight,”
11.920000	16.040000		the **Spartan**^[a person from the city of Sparta in Greece] **chief**^[A chief is the leader of a group of people.] told his small army of **brave**^[A brave person is not afraid to face pain or danger.] men.
16.790000	19.360000		They were at a great **disadvantage**^[A disadvantage is a situation that makes it hard to do something.].
19.780000	22.190000		There were only three hundred of them.
22.750000	27.100000		The Persian **military**^[The military is the armed forces of a country.] had hundreds of thousands of men.

28.540000	33.110000		They were going to lose **unless**^[Unless means if not or except when.] they could **secure**^[To secure something means to get it after a lot of effort.] a small **entrance**^[An entrance is a place where someone can enter an area.].
33.560000	36.440000		The **enemy**^[An enemy is a country that is fighting another country during a war.] couldn't move through it easily.
37.070000	40.030000		They **intended**^[To intend to do something means to plan to do it.] to stop the enemy there.
40.550000	43.820000		The chief and his men got ready for the **battle**^[A battle is a fight between two armies during a war.].

45.120000	50.280000		Soon, long lines of the enemy's army **twisted**^[When we twist something we turn it around and around.] around the hills.
51.050000	53.820000		The chief met the enemy with **laughter**^[Laughter is the sound produced by laughing about something funny.].
54.570000	58.250000		He knew that his men's **weapons**^[A weapon is an object used to hurt people.] and skills were better.
58.780000	62.340000		The Spartans **trusted**^[To trust is to believe that someone is honest and will do what is right.] their leader and **obeyed**^[To obey means to follow what a law or a person says to do.] him.

63.450000	67.890000		First, the enemy soldiers shot **arrows**^[An arrow is a thin, straight stick shot from a bow.] from their **bows**^[A bow is a weapon made of curved wood and string that shoots arrows.].
68.320000	71.830000		The chief told his men to lift their shields^[a piece of wood or metal that soldiers carried to protect themselves].
72.420000	74.980000		The arrows **stuck into**^[cắm vào] the shields
75.030000	77.480000		but did not hurt any of the men.

78.300000	83.570000		Then, the enemy's soldiers attacked the Spartans with long **spears**^[cây thương].
84.300000	86.180000		The chief surprised them.
87.510000	91.150000		His men sent **logs**^[A log is a thick piece of wood that is cut from a tree.] down the hills at the enemy.

92.630000	94.790000		They fought for three days.
95.110000	97.510000		Although they **hardly**^[Hardly shows that something happens in a very small way.] slept at all,
97.640000	100.460000		the chief and his men remained **steady**^[Steady shows that someone or something does not change much.].

101.780000	105.520000		But the enemy found a way to beat the Spartans.
106.050000	109.410000		The chief and all of his men were killed.
109.910000	111.560000		Even though they lost,
111.710000	116.710000		the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the most famous battles in history.
