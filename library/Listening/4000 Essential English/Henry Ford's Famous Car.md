4.670000	6.803020		My name is Henry Ford,
6.727431	9.740000		and I **invented**^[To invent is to create something that never existed before.] a car called the Model T.
10.030000	13.020000		I used to watch **carriages**^[A carriage is a vehicle pulled by a horse.] on the streets.
13.130000	14.880000		They were very interesting.
15.200000	18.570000		Then, I got a job as a **junior**^[A junior person is younger or less experienced.] **mechanic**^[A mechanic is someone who fixes vehicles or machines.].
18.880000	20.930000		My father **criticized**^[To criticize is to say bad things about someone or something.] me.
21.040000	23.210000		He wanted me to run the farm.

23.780000	25.960000		When I **shifted**^[To shift is to move into a different place or direction.] to Detroit,
25.910000	28.450000		I worked for the Detroit Auto Company.
28.730000	32.010000		But I wanted to make cars using less **labor**^[Labor is the act of doing or making something.].
33.040000	36.040000		That way, there would be fewer **expenses**^[An expense is the money that people spend on something.].
36.210000	39.680000		I started the Ford Motor Company in 1903.
39.890000	43.050000		At first, the company did not do well.
43.100000	46.290000		But many people were **betting**^[To bet is to risk money on the result of a game or a business.] on my success.
46.560000	51.250000		I also had a **sincere**^[A sincere person is honest, especially about emotions or opinions.] **aim**^[An aim is a goal someone wants to make happen.] to make a car that anybody could buy.

51.590000	53.420000		Then, in 1908,
53.330000	55.560000		I introduced the Model T.
55.840000	58.140000		It **confirmed**^[To confirm is to make sure something is correct.] that I was right:
58.090000	61.360000		it was possible to build a car my way!

62.200000	65.150000		The Model T **differed**^[To differ is to not be the same as another person or thing.] from other vehicles.
65.290000	68.700000		Each worker would **attach**^[To attach is to put two things together.] a different part to the car.
68.910000	72.780000		This made their job easy to learn and saved a lot of time.
73.430000	77.480000		One Model T could be **put together**^[lắp ráp] in 93 minutes.
77.850000	80.580000		All of them had the same **classic**^[A classic thing is something that is common from the past.] design.
80.770000	83.320000		They were all the same size and **height**^[Height is how tall someone or something is.].
83.620000	87.130000		The **prime**^[Prime shows that something is the most important one.] reason for doing this was to save money.
87.590000	93.990000		We had a **formal ceremony**^[buổi lễ trang trọng] to celebrate our success when the millionth car was made in our factory.

94.510000	96.310000		Over 19 years,
96.220000	99.700000		I sold more than 15 million Model Ts.
99.930000	102.740000		This sent a **signal**^[A signal is a sound or action that tells someone to do something.] to other companies.
102.910000	107.530000		People would buy cars to **commute**^[To commute is to travel a long distance to get to work.] to work if the price was low enough.
