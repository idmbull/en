4.190000	6.680000		A deer told himself every day,
7.130000	10.370000		"I am the most handsome deer in the forest.
10.560000	13.650000		My large **chest**^[The chest is the front part of a body between the neck and stomach.] shows my power.
13.720000	17.950000		And my beautiful **horns**^[cái sừng] **impress**^[To impress someone means to make that person proud or amazed.] other animals.”

18.720000	22.430000		But he did not like his legs and **hooves**^[the feet of animals like deer and horses].
23.030000	25.030000		"My legs are **narrow**^[A narrow object or space is thin, not wide.],
24.990000	27.030000		and my hooves are **ugly**^[xấu xí].
27.140000	29.380000		They do not **satisfy**^[To satisfy someone means to make that person happy.] me."

30.020000	33.400000		One day, the deer saw a big dog.
33.560000	37.440000		The deer made some noise and **disturbed**^[To disturb someone means to upset that person.] the dog.
37.610000	39.160000		The dog woke up
38.990000	40.780000		and ran after him.
41.060000	43.040000		The deer felt **terror**^[Terror is a feeling of very strong fear.].
43.100000	44.490000		He **screamed**^[To scream means to make a loud noise with your mouth.].
44.610000	46.920000		He did not want to be a **victim**^[A victim is a person who is hurt by a bad action.],
46.910000	49.140000		so he ran into the forest.
49.380000	52.590000		His strong legs helped him run fast.
52.730000	55.340000		His **pale**^[Pale means that a color or thing is not bright.] brown hooves were hard,
55.260000	58.390000		so they were not **sensitive**^[A sensitive person or thing is easily hurt.] to the **rough**^[A rough thing is not even or smooth.] rocks.
58.720000	63.610000		However, his horns **got caught**^[vướng vào] in branches and slowed him down.
63.880000	68.330000		His large chest could not fit between the thick trees.

69.210000	72.280000		The deer **estimated**^[To estimate something means to make a guess about it.] that he ran for an hour.
72.500000	75.990000		He felt like he was running to the limit of his **strength**^[Strength is the ability to do hard work or exercise.].
76.380000	77.500000		In the end,
77.500000	80.310000		the deer **escaped**^[thoát khỏi] the **threat**^[A threat is something bad that might happen.] of the dog.
80.770000	82.960000		He sat in the **shade**^[Shade is a dark area that something makes when it blocks the sun.] of a tree.
83.470000	85.830000		“That was almost a **disaster**^[A disaster is a really bad thing that happens.]!
86.020000	90.670000		I almost did not escape because of my chest and horns.
90.860000	93.450000		My legs and hooves saved me."
94.260000	95.820000		As a **consequence**^[A consequence is a result of a choice or action.],
95.860000	98.980000		the deer learned to **honor**^[To honor is to show respect for someone or something.] his fast legs
98.880000	102.050000		and have **confidence**^[Confidence is a feeling of certainty or ability.] in his strong hooves.
102.610000	106.610000		"Pretty things only **supplement**^[To supplement something is to add something else to it in a good way.] important things,”
106.440000	107.440000		he thought.
