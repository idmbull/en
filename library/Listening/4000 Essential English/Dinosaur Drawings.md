4.210000	6.670000		It was the worst morning ever.
6.880000	8.610000		When Carl woke up,
8.640000	13.000000		he realized that he hadn't done his **astronomy**^[Astronomy is the study of the stars and planets.] and **chemistry**^[Chemistry is the study of substances and reactions between them.] homework.
13.380000	16.470000		Also, the **forecast**^[A forecast is an idea about what the weather will be like in the future.] called for rain,
16.490000	19.300000		and that would mean no baseball practice.
19.790000	20.840000		Suddenly,
20.860000	22.530000		his mother **interfered**^[To interfere is to cause problems and keep something from happening.]:
22.990000	25.480000		"Take out the garbage right now!"
25.920000	30.640000		When Carl returned from taking the garbage outside, he was all **wet**^[A wet thing has water on it.].
31.370000	33.360000		"What a terrible day,"
33.560000	34.550000		he said.

35.580000	37.310000		He walked to class.
37.580000	41.500000		He put his **umbrella**^[cái ô] on the **shelf**^[A shelf is a place on a wall where you put things.] and sat in the third **row**^[A row is a line of things.].
41.860000	45.880000		But the teacher asked why Carl's umbrella was on the floor.
46.437384	48.888682		He told her not to **blame**^[To blame someone for something bad is to say they did it.] him
48.829851	50.747384		because it had fallen down.
51.370000	55.200000		But she sent him to the **principal**^[A principal is a person in charge of a school.] anyway out of **spite**^[Spite is the desire to be mean.].

56.220000	59.290000		Next, he took a **geography**^[Geography is the study of the Earth, its land, weather, etc.] test.
59.410000	61.070000		**Despite**^[Despite shows a difference from what is expected.] studying,
61.090000	63.600000		Carl didn't know the answers.
63.950000	67.540000		He started drawing patterns **lightly**^[To do something lightly is to not push very hard.] on his paper.

68.580000	71.600000		Carl drew a huge **dinosaur**^[A dinosaur is a very big animal that lived millions of years ago.].
72.480000	74.170000		What if it were real?
74.620000	76.690000		He saw it in his mind.
77.030000	81.760000		Carl's friends said he was a **genius**^[A genius is a very smart person.] for creating a dinosaur.
82.200000	86.250000		Soon, Carl's **fame**^[Fame is a reputation one has gained among the public.] spread through school.

86.360000	89.530000		He taught his dinosaur to be very **gentle**^[Someone who is gentle is kind and calm.]
89.510000	91.940000		and **exhibited**^[To exhibit is to show something so that people can go look at it.] it to the public.
92.250000	96.620000		But **admission**^[Admission is the act of allowing to enter a place.] would only be given to those who paid him a fee.
97.130000	99.210000		His idea was **super**^[Super means really good.].

100.170000	102.610000		"It's time to **turn in**^[nộp lại (giao nộp thứ không còn thuộc quyền giữ của mình)] your tests,"
102.710000	104.160000		the teacher said.
104.760000	106.920000		Carl looked at his paper.
107.260000	109.560000		As he was dreaming in class,
109.700000	111.810000		he hadn't finished the test!
