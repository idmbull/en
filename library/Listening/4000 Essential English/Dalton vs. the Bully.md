4.150000	6.100000		Dalton was a nice boy,
6.010000	10.750000		but sometimes the other boys made fun of him because he was so tall and **skinny**^[very thin].
11.280000	14.110000		Dalton's biggest problem was Mitch.
14.560000	17.400000		He was a **bully**^[Kẻ bắt nạt, kẻ hay ức hiếp người yếu thế hơn.] who **boasted**^[khoe khoang] about his strength.
17.960000	20.020000		He **quarreled**^[To quarrel is to argue or fight.] with the other boys.
20.360000	23.700000		Sometimes, if boys gave Mitch their lunch money,
23.700000	26.140000		he would have **mercy**^[lòng khoan dung hoặc sự nhân từ] and leave them alone.

26.850000	31.090000		One day, the boys learned about a special Middle School Olympics.
31.520000	33.980000		Their gym class was going to be in it.
34.510000	36.470000		Many kids were excited.
36.920000	39.910000		But Dalton thought it sounded like **torture**^[Hành động tra tấn hoặc một trải nghiệm gây đau khổ cực độ].

40.930000	42.150000		That morning,
42.070000	45.240000		Dalton ate plenty of **carbohydrates**^[tinh bột] for breakfast.
45.790000	48.910000		He entered the gym and looked at the **dial**^[A dial is a circular tool, like the front of a clock.] on the clock.
49.230000	51.000000		It was time to begin.
51.610000	53.970000		The teacher asked if they were ready.
54.400000	57.020000		Everyone **nodded**^[gật đầu], except Dalton.

57.490000	59.330000		"I **got stung**^[bị đốt] by a bee.
59.310000	60.980000		I need to see the nurse,"
61.020000	62.220000		said Dalton.
62.750000	65.900000		He made this story up so he wouldn't have to play.

66.540000	67.873380		"I don't believe you.
67.827652	69.230000		Get ready to play,"
69.451022	71.121022		responded the coach.

72.070000	73.630000		First, they **wrestled**^[đấu vật].
73.840000	75.210000		Then, they jumped,
75.130000	77.270000		crawled, and played other games.
77.670000	80.590000		But Mitch was **dominant**^[thống trị] in every event.

81.470000	84.150000		They **strained**^[To strain is to try very hard.] all morning to defeat him.
84.460000	87.300000		By lunch, the **entire** team were **sore**^[đau nhức],
87.220000	89.460000		but they thought they knew how to win.
90.160000	93.090000		They knew the last game of the day was volleyball.
93.830000	97.800000		Kids who used to be Dalton's **rivals**^[A rival is someone trying to achieve the same thing as another.] became his **allies**^[An ally is someone who agrees to help or support another person or group.].
98.330000	101.240000		They wanted him to help them beat Mitch.
101.880000	104.620000		Dalton was going to be Mitch's **opponent**^[An opponent is a person or group trying to defeat another person or group.].

105.190000	106.670000		The game started.
107.020000	110.150000		Every time Mitch tried to hit the ball over the net,
110.140000	111.710000		Dalton stopped it.
112.130000	115.200000		Finally, Mitch used all of his strength.
115.900000	120.240000		But the ball **bounced**^[Nảy lên, tâng lên] off Dalton's hands and back into Mitch's face!
120.620000	123.100000		Finally, Mitch was defeated.
