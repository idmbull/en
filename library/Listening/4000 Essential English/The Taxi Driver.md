4.050000	7.810000		Peter's job was driving a taxi **downtown**^[The downtown area is the center of most cities.].
8.050000	9.940000		He made a small **salary**^[A salary is how much money a person makes at his or her job.].
10.100000	13.470000		But he liked his job because it wasn't **dull**^[If something is dull, it is not exciting.].
13.780000	17.400000		Every day, he saw new things that **appealed**^[To appeal to someone is to be interesting or attractive.] to him.
17.680000	20.540000		Peter was **practical**^[If something is practical, it is useful.] about the future.^[Peter có cái nhìn thực tế về tương lai. (be practical = suy nghĩ/hành động dựa trên thực tế.)]
20.940000	24.760000		"Maybe I can get a **scholarship**^[A scholarship is money given so someone can go to school.] for college," he thought.
25.130000	28.620000		"I could study **accounting**^[People study accounting so they can deal with money and finance properly.] and get a job at a bank.

32.480000	35.250000		Peter stopped to **pick up a passenger**^[đón khách].
35.570000	36.650000		"Where to?"
36.800000	37.710000		he asked.

38.060000	40.260000		“Go to the Fourth Street Bank.
40.210000	41.520000		And don't talk to me.
41.520000	43.000000		I've had a **rough day**^[mệt mỏi, căng thẳng, nhiều rắc rối],”
43.310000	44.690000		the man said.
44.980000	47.370000		Peter was a peaceful person,
47.370000	49.260000		so he was not angry.
49.470000	50.780000		When they stopped,
50.700000	54.700000		the man's **fare**^[A fare is an amount of money paid to use a bus, train, or taxi.] came to $10.25.
55.000000	57.250000		He put his hands in his pockets.
58.030000	59.890000		"I can't find my wallet!"
60.130000	61.020000		he said.
61.440000	63.080000		"I can't pay the fare!"

63.520000	64.760000		Peter said,
65.230000	67.440000		"I'll give you a **temporary**^[If something is temporary, it exists for a short time.] **loan**^[A loan is something, usually money, that one person lends to another.].

70.860000	73.160000		The man was **embarrassed**^[To embarrass people is to make them feel ashamed or foolish.] and said,
73.470000	74.790000		"I was **mean**^[Xấu tính, ác độc, hèn hạ] to you,
74.760000	76.580000		but now I want to help you.
77.010000	78.870000		I **founded**^[To found a company or organization means to start it.] this bank.
78.950000	81.250000		I want to give you a hundred dollars."
82.070000	85.260000		That much money was like a **treasure**^[A treasure is a collection of valuable things, especially jewels or gold.] to Peter.
85.560000	88.120000		The man **urged**^[To urge someone is to try very hard to get them to do something.] him to take the money,
88.120000	89.460000		but he didn't.

90.460000	92.360000		"You're an **honest person**^[trung thực],”
92.610000	93.980000		the man said.
94.600000	96.560000		"I **assumed**^[To assume something is to think that it is true, even with no proof.] you would take it.
96.770000	98.460000		I want you to work for me."

99.610000	101.000000		The next day,
100.940000	103.970000		Peter started his job at the bank.
104.190000	107.430000		He was happy to leave his **former**^[Former describes something that used to be but is not anymore.] job.
