4.400000	8.540000		Dr. Norton's **occupation**^[An occupation is a person's job.] was a **scholar**^[A scholar is a person who studies something and knows a lot about it.] of **biology**^[Biology is the study of living things.].

27.130000	28.840000		They **debated**^[To debate is to seriously discuss something with someone.] with him:
29.100000	32.470000		no one thought a bird would be able to talk.

51.400000	56.000000		The sailor he had met told him to look for a man named Jai,
56.310000	59.110000		who would be able to help him in his search.
59.630000	61.540000		After a month of sailing,
61.590000	65.850000		Dr. Norton finally reached the colony, where he met Jai.

66.660000	70.930000		"I can take you to where it lives. It lives by the volcano,"
71.350000	72.580000		Jai said.

73.620000	75.450000		They left the next day.

77.090000	79.220000		they arrived at the **volcano**^[A volcano is a mountain with a hole on top where hot liquid comes out.].
79.520000	80.680000		Every day,
80.600000	83.520000		they walked around and looked for the bird,
83.560000	85.390000		but they couldn't find it.
85.900000	87.410000		After one month,
87.450000	90.590000		Dr. Norton could not find the bird,
90.800000	92.370000		and this **depressed**^[To depress someone is to make that person sad.] him.

96.220000	97.770000		On the **route**^[A route is the way you go from one place to another.] back,
97.740000	100.330000		he walked past some old **ruins**^[Ruins are old buildings that are not used anymore.].
100.510000	102.100000		He heard someone say,
102.340000	103.160000		"Hello.”

103.790000	105.000000		"Who are you?"
105.200000	106.150000		he asked.
106.510000	109.990000		Dr. Norton looked up and saw a bird!
110.410000	114.410000		Dr. Norton put the talking bird into a **cage**^[A cage is something that holds an animal so it cannot leave.].
