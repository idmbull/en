4.300000	6.560000		**Old Archie**^[ông già Archie] needed some money.
6.870000	9.120000		He decided to sell his **donkey**^[con lừa].
9.570000	12.520000		So he and his son Tom went to town.
12.810000	15.550000		It was **situated**^[If something is situated somewhere, it is in that place.] many miles away.

16.870000	18.580000		Soon, they met a woman.
19.040000	20.730000		“Where are you going?"
20.890000	21.920000		she asked.
22.340000	23.350000		“To town,”
23.410000	24.480000		said Archie.

25.270000	28.090000		"Any smart person would **ride**^[To ride something is to travel on it. You can ride an animal, a bike, etc.] the donkey,"
28.410000	29.320000		she said.

29.870000	31.520000		"What are you **implying**^[To imply something is to suggest it without saying it.]?"
31.680000	32.780000		Archie asked.
32.960000	34.500000		"I'm very smart!"
35.300000	37.360000		Archie wanted to look smart.
37.610000	39.940000		So he **climbed**^[To climb means to use your hands and feet to go up something.] onto the donkey.
40.460000	43.270000		Then they continued in the direction of the town.

44.080000	45.660000		**Further**^[Further means at or from a greater distance or time.] **along**^[Along means down the length of a road, river, etc.] the road,
45.760000	47.210000		they met a farmer.

47.720000	49.690000		"Hello," said Archie.
50.060000	52.250000		"We want to sell this donkey.
52.610000	54.220000		Do you want to buy it?"

55.440000	57.290000		“I don't need a donkey,”
57.420000	58.540000		said the farmer.
59.010000	61.220000		“But if you want my **advice**^[Advice is an opinion about what to do.],
61.330000	62.530000		don't ride it.
62.890000	66.290000		The donkey needs to be in good **physical**^[If something is physical, it is related to your body and not your mind.] condition."

67.420000	68.510000		"Good idea,"
68.590000	69.580000		said Archie.
69.850000	72.240000		"Tom, I want you to ride it.
72.460000	73.440000		You're lighter."

74.700000	77.250000		"**Neither**^[You use neither to connect two negative possibilities.] you nor your son should ride it.
77.660000	79.420000		It looks very tired.
79.760000	81.600000		You should carry the donkey,"
81.960000	83.470000		**suggested**^[To suggest something means to give an idea or plan about it.] the farmer.

84.160000	85.100000		"You're right,"
85.230000	86.190000		said Archie.
86.500000	87.760000		"Come on, Tom!
87.960000	90.780000		We'll carry it for the **final**^[If something is final, it is the last part.] few miles!"
91.470000	93.450000		The donkey was very heavy,
93.620000	96.280000		and they couldn't **maintain**^[To maintain means to make something stay the same.] a good speed.
96.830000	99.750000		They didn't arrive until late in the evening.
100.210000	102.770000		At last, they walked into the town.
103.270000	107.430000		But there, they **attracted**^[To attract means to make a person or thing come closer or be interested.] the **attention**^[Attention is the notice, thought, or consideration of someone.] of some teenage boys.
107.830000	109.940000		They laughed at Tom and Archie.
110.410000	112.760000		They started to **throw stones**^[ném đá] at them.
113.140000	115.560000		The donkey **reacted**^[To react is to respond by acting in a certain way.] by kicking.
116.000000	118.420000		Tom and Archie **dropped**^[To drop is to fall or allow something to fall.] the donkey.
118.840000	120.530000		It fell on the ground
120.590000	122.380000		and then ran away.
122.940000	124.940000		Archie lost his donkey.
125.270000	127.460000		He went home with no money.

128.540000	130.730000		What does this story teach us?
131.240000	134.440000		We cannot please everyone in our **society**^[Society is a group of people who interact and share a culture.].
135.040000	137.060000		Don't take everyone's advice,
137.280000	139.440000		but set your own **standards**^[A standard is what people consider normal or good.].
139.890000	143.590000		**Prove**^[To prove something is to show that it is true.] to everyone that you can **make decisions**^[đưa ra quyết định] by yourself.
144.080000	145.040000		**Otherwise**^[Otherwise means in another way if you don't do this.],
145.100000	147.800000		you may end up with nothing at all.
