3.950000	6.760000		A rich **senator**^[thượng nghị sĩ] lived in a big house.
6.770000	9.910000		He had more money than anyone in his **district**^[huyện].
10.270000	14.800000		One day, he was sitting on a chair listening to a radio broadcast.
15.040000	17.700000		As he listened to the news **bulletin**^[bulletin is a news report about very recent and important events.],
17.680000	20.650000		a **worm**^[con giun đất] crawled from **underneath**^[bên dưới] the chair
20.520000	22.110000		and onto his head.

22.670000	26.350000		His cook was in the kitchen **stirring**^[khuấy] some spaghetti sauce.
26.560000	30.410000		Suddenly, a cry from the senator alerted him.
30.660000	32.875062		He ran to the **rear**^[The rear of something is the back part of that thing.] of the house
32.804741	34.690000		where the senator was sitting.

35.260000	37.650000		The cook looked and saw the worm.
37.850000	40.060000		He tried to **console**^[To console is to give comfort to a person who feels sad.] the senator.
40.680000	42.800000		"I'll take it off right away,"
42.760000	43.740000		he said.

43.880000	46.160000		"No!" shouted the senator.
46.270000	48.010000		"I want you to kill it."

48.720000	50.600000		"But it's only a worm,"
50.620000	51.790000		the cook said.
51.990000	53.830000		"Why should we **execute**^[xử tử] it?
53.890000	55.890000		It hasn't committed a crime"

56.410000	59.630000		The senator could not **endure**^[To endure means to experience and survive something difficult.] the worm on his head.
59.830000	61.790000		"Hurry!" he shouted.

62.430000	65.900000		The cook looked through several **drawers**^[ngăn kéo] but found nothing.
66.030000	69.500000		Then he ran to the **closet**^[A closet is a small room used to store things.] and took out a pipe.
69.850000	71.660000		He returned to the senator
71.590000	73.910000		and lifted the pipe over his head.
74.720000	77.290000		He knew he couldn't just **tap**^[To tap something is to hit it lightly.] the worm.
77.420000	79.330000		He was going to hit it hard.
79.590000	81.810000		He **grasped**^[To grasp something means to hold it.] the pipe tightly.

82.580000	84.300000		"What are you waiting for?"
84.240000	85.500000		said the senator.
85.600000	86.420000		"Kill it!"

86.850000	89.790000		The cook swung the pipe at the senator's head.

90.250000	91.370000		"Oh, no,"
91.280000	92.650000		the worm said.
92.720000	94.820000		"He's going to **chop**^[To chop something means to cut it into pieces with a tool.] me in half."
95.360000	97.780000		It jumped off the senator's head.

98.140000	100.390000		There was a **tremendous**^[A tremendous thing is very large or very good.] noise.
100.660000	101.940000		"Owww!"
102.000000	103.300000		cried the senator.

103.720000	106.190000		A **bump**^[vết sưng] rose upon his **skull**^[hộp sọ].
106.440000	109.370000		**Meanwhile**^[trong khi đó], the worm crawled outside.
109.950000	111.450000		"That was close,"
111.310000	112.510000		said the worm.
112.650000	114.490000		"Instead of being nice,
114.370000	116.020000		he wanted to hurt me.
116.140000	119.480000		Now, that man has a big bump on his head."
