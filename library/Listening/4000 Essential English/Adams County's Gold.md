4.260000	6.910000		Adams **Academy**^[An academy is a special type of school.] was a good school.
7.300000	9.840000		Boys lived there and took classes.
10.050000	12.150000		Tom **worked hard**^[học tập chăm chỉ] all week.
12.910000	16.430000		On a spring Saturday, he wanted to do something fun.

16.860000	20.120000		He asked his friend Jeff to go to **the movie theater**^[cinema (UK)]
20.650000	22.630000		"Sorry," Jeff answered.
22.920000	24.700000		"I'm going to a **concert**^[A concert is an event where you listen to people play music.]."

25.600000	28.970000		So Tom asked Joe to go to the movies.
29.260000	31.690000		But Joe's soccer team had a game.

32.340000	35.930000		Next, Tom went down the **hall**^[hành lang] to Brad's room.
36.360000	39.360000		Brad was reading a very large old book.
40.210000	41.230000		“Hi, Brad,”
41.240000	42.300000		Tom said.
42.760000	44.840000		“Are you reading a **dictionary**^[A dictionary is a book that tells you what words mean.]?
44.930000	46.370000		It looks **ancient**^[If something is ancient, it is very old.]."

47.430000	51.490000		"No. This is called _The **Wealth** of Adams **County**_.
51.850000	54.930000		It's about **hidden**^[Hidden means not easily noticed or too hard to find.] gold in Adams **County**^[Quận, Hạt (mỗi state gồm nhiều county)].
55.270000	57.560000		It's more than a **century**^[A century is one hundred years.] old.
57.800000	60.410000		It was **published**^[To publish a book is to get it printed and ready to sell.] in 1870!
60.830000	64.490000		Look, it even has the **original**^[If something is original, it is the first one of that thing.] cover on it."

65.430000	66.510000		Tom asked,
66.830000	68.250000		"Where did you get it?"

69.070000	71.170000		"It's from my dad's friend.
71.370000	73.190000		He is a nice **gentleman**^[A gentleman is a nice man.],
73.220000	74.990000		an **officer**^[An officer is a leader in the army.] in the army,"
75.140000	76.410000		answered Brad.

77.340000	79.890000		"The gold doesn't really **exist**^[To exist is to be real.],
79.870000	81.790000		does it?" Tom asked.

82.440000	84.480000		"I don't know, but **maybe**^[Maybe is used to show that something is possible or may be true.]!
84.630000	86.510000		There are **clues**^[A clue is a fact or object that helps solve a mystery or crime.] in this book.
86.900000	88.180000		Let's find it!"
88.730000	91.440000		Looking for gold sounded like fun.

91.870000	96.150000		The first clue was to find a **flat**^[Flat describes something that is level and smooth with no curved parts.] tree underground.
96.960000	98.940000		"It must be in the forest,"
98.870000	99.960000		Tom said.

100.370000	101.500000		Brad said,
101.890000	105.180000		"The flat tree could be a **board**^[A board is a flat piece of wood.] under the dirt.
105.330000	107.210000		It could cover the gold."

108.260000	111.700000		Tom and Brad dug in the dirt all morning.
112.120000	115.480000		The **process**^[A process is the steps to take to do something.] of looking for gold made them hungry.
115.980000	118.370000		They were ready to stop for lunch.
118.820000	121.290000		But then Brad hit something hard.
121.670000	123.040000		It was a board!

123.530000	126.380000		Brad **pounded**^[To pound something is to hit it many times with a lot of force.] on the board until it broke.
126.950000	129.170000		There was a small hole under it.
129.750000	132.910000		"Look!" He held up a gold coin.

133.390000	136.270000		Tom saw a piece of paper in the hole.
137.230000	138.990000		"Brad, there's more.
139.100000	141.470000		It's a map to **the rest of**^[The rest of + Noun (Phần còn lại)] the gold!"
141.960000	143.150000		Brad smiled.
143.530000	144.690000		"Let's go!"
145.170000	148.530000		And they hurried to find the wealth of Adams County.
