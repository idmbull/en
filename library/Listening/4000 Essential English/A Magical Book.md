24.670000	27.280000		Her parents **made**^[bắt, ép, khiến (quá khứ của make)] her play basketball.
27.700000	31.820000		In fact, Sarah's parents made her do many things.
32.150000	34.890000		But she didn't want to do those things.
35.130000	38.750000		She just wanted to sit and read all day.

40.120000	43.340000		One day, a small book came in the **mail**^[Mail is letters and other things sent to people.].
43.630000	45.050000		It was for Sarah.

47.780000	50.340000		It was **printed**^[To print something is to put it onto paper.] on **sheets**^[A sheet is a thin flat piece of paper.] of gold.
50.830000	52.760000		Sarah began to read.
53.100000	55.530000		The **outline**^[An outline is the plan for a story or essay.] of the story was simple.

65.950000	67.210000		In one **scene**^[A scene is one part of a book or movie.],
67.250000	70.030000		he made his friends tell **funny jokes**^[những câu chuyện cười / câu nói đùa vui nhộn].

71.224390	73.064390		Sarah loved the book.
73.390000	75.490000		She read it all the time.
75.960000	78.380000		Then something strange happened.
78.590000	81.620000		The book gave Sarah a special power.
81.970000	84.280000		She could control other people.
84.550000	86.860000		She was like the boy in the book.
87.500000	89.040000		During one **exam**^[An exam is a test.],
88.980000	91.820000		she made her friend tell **silly**^[People who are silly show a lack of serious thought.] jokes.
92.000000	94.000000		Her friend **got in trouble**^[gặp rắc rồi].

95.100000	96.330000		After school,
96.330000	99.260000		Sarah did not make a **direct**^[If something is direct, it goes straight between two places.] trip home.
99.670000	100.800000		**On the way**^[trên đường đi],
100.780000	102.880000		she went to the **local** **store**.
103.120000	106.060000		She wanted to **play more tricks on**^[play tricks on someone: trêu chọc / chơi khăm ai đó] people.
106.340000	108.240000		She made problems.
108.420000	110.620000		She made people **fall down**^[ngã xuống mặt đất].
110.910000	113.240000		She laughed and had fun.

114.360000	115.880000		Finally she left
115.900000	117.870000		and started to walk home.
118.420000	120.200000		Then she saw something.
120.550000	124.540000		Her basketball **coach**^[A coach is a person who teaches sports.] **was about to**^[diễn tả hành động sắp xảy ra ngay lập tức] walk in front of a bus.
124.810000	126.970000		He was looking the other way.
127.280000	129.160000		She had to stop him!
129.500000	131.270000		She used her power.
131.440000	133.010000		She controlled him.
133.140000	135.310000		She made him stop walking.

136.340000	138.510000		Sarah learned something that day.
138.900000	142.634864		It was better to help people than make them **suffer**^[To suffer is to feel pain.].
143.000000	146.600000		So, she put a **limit**^[A limit is the largest or smallest amount of something that you allow.] on how she used her power.
146.910000	150.560000		She did not want to do bad things with it anymore.
150.770000	153.140000		She only wanted to do good.
