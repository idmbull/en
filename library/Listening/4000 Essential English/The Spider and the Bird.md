4.548847	7.528847		**There was once**^[Once there was (Ngày xưa (once))] a very big **spider**^[A spider is a small creature with eight legs.].
8.280000	11.950000		However, if a bug got into his web,
11.970000	14.210000		he didn't eat it right away.
14.660000	16.780000		He would carefully **examine**^[To examine something is to look at it carefully.] it.
17.160000	19.920000		He asked the bug a question first.
20.230000	23.220000		It was always **quite**^[Quite means that something is a certain way completely or very much.] a difficult **puzzle**^[A puzzle is something that is hard to understand.].
23.730000	26.190000		If the bug's answer was correct,
26.230000	27.420000		he let it go.
27.720000	28.740000		If not,
28.760000	29.900000		he ate it.

31.200000	34.460000		One day, a small bird on a **journey**^[A journey is a long trip.]
34.390000	36.780000		flew into the spider's web.
37.420000	40.950000		The spider couldn't **imagine**^[To imagine something is to think of it in your mind.] eating a bird.
40.960000	42.610000		It was so big!
43.770000	46.670000		But his **hunger**^[Hunger is the feeling that you get when you need to eat.] was too great.
47.050000	48.460000		He said to the bird,
49.040000	52.120000		"If you cannot give me a **specific**^[If something is specific, it is precise or exact.] answer,
52.240000	53.570000		I will eat you."

54.560000	56.190000		The bird laughed.
56.830000	58.240000		“I could eat you!”
58.790000	61.660000		But the bird was **actually**^[Actually means in fact or really.] scared.
62.000000	66.160000		She had used all her energy trying to get out of the web.
66.600000	68.160000		And a spider's **bite**^[Bite is the act of using your teeth to cut and tear into something.]
68.200000	71.480000		can be very **effective**^[If something is effective, it works well.] in killing animals.

72.150000	73.840000		"Please don't eat me,"
74.470000	75.670000		the bird said.
76.050000	78.250000		"I **would**^[dùng để diễn tả mong muốn hoặc sự ưu tiên lựa chọn cái này hơn cái kia.] **rather**^[Rather is used when you want to do one thing but not the other.] make a **deal**^[A deal is an agreement that you have with another person.] with you."

78.870000	79.660000		"OK"
79.940000	81.260000		the spider said.
81.670000	83.430000		"If your answer is right,
83.590000	85.010000		I will let you go.
85.290000	86.150000		If not,
86.420000	88.210000		you must give me a **gift**^[A gift is something you give someone.].
88.840000	91.669652		It must be something of great value!"

92.780000	93.950000		The bird said,
94.520000	97.070000		"You can **pick**^[chọn] anything you want to eat.
97.180000	98.800000		I will find it for you."
99.440000	101.290000		The spider agreed.

102.030000	104.820000		"Where can you take a **trip**^[A trip is a journey to a certain place.] to the **coast**^[The coast is the land by an ocean.],
104.810000	108.530000		the **desert**^[The desert is an area of land without many plants or water.], and the mountains at the same time?"
109.210000	110.680000		the spider asked.

111.750000	113.040000		The bird said,
113.510000	116.090000		"Can you help me **figure that one out**^[When you figure something out, you come to understand it and find an answer.]?"
116.870000	120.000000		But the spider did not say anything.
120.540000	123.560000		"I can see those places when I fly.
124.160000	126.750000		Is the 'sky' the right answer?"
127.390000	128.470000		"**False**^[If something is false, it is not correct.]!"
128.930000	130.380000		said the spider.
131.160000	133.050000		"The answer is Hawaii!
133.420000	136.220000		Now you must find some bugs for me."

137.460000	140.710000		The spider climbed on the bird's back.
141.420000	144.330000		They flew and ate bugs together.
145.310000	147.800000		They took a **tour**^[A tour is a short trip in which you see many sights.] of the forest.
148.420000	151.090000		Then the bird took the spider home.
151.820000	153.260000		From that day on,
153.260000	154.740000		they were friends.
155.200000	158.701641		And they never tried to eat each other again.
