4.370000	6.970000		In English, there is a **common**^[If something is common, it happens often or there is much of it.] **idiom**^[An idiom is a phrase with a meaning different from its words.]:
7.290000	9.120000		"let the cat out of the bag."
9.770000	12.110000		It means to tell a secret.
12.740000	14.780000		But where did this idiom start?

15.860000	17.890000		It came from a part of England.
18.300000	25.320000		Long ago, people there went from town to town to sell things like vegetables, clothes, and pigs.
25.850000	28.490000		They had strong **beliefs**^[A belief is a strong feeling that something is correct or true.] about **honesty**^[Honesty means the quality of being truthful or honest.].
28.960000	30.590000		They didn't like lying.
31.320000	35.710000		One day, a man went to the town's **center**^[The center of something is the middle of it.] to sell things.

36.390000	38.560000		"I have a baby pig for **sale**^[If something is for sale, you can buy it.]!
38.610000	40.120000		It won't **cost**^[To cost is to require payment.] much,"
40.380000	41.120000		he said.
41.560000	43.770000		He held the animal **above**^[If something is above, it is at a higher level than something else.] his head.
44.290000	47.560000		His style was **different**^[Different describes someone or something that is not the same as others.] from honest people's style.
47.870000	51.230000		He was a **master**^[A master is a person who is very good at something.] of tricking people and lying.

51.950000	54.690000		A woman named Beth looked at his pig.
55.160000	58.100000		He offered her the pig for one gold coin.
58.670000	60.840000		That was a very small **amount**^[An amount is how much there is of something.].
61.290000	62.970000		Beth gave him the coin.
63.370000	64.980000		He put it in his **pocket**^[A pocket is a part of your clothing where you can keep things.].
65.410000	67.940000		He walked **ahead**^[If something is ahead of something else, it is in front of it.] of Beth to get the pig.

68.600000	70.410000		He gave her a closed bag
70.490000	71.340000		and said,
71.640000	72.770000		"Here's your pig."
73.380000	75.430000		He then left very quickly.

76.190000	77.670000		Beth looked at the bag.
78.150000	79.320000		It was moving.
79.790000	81.970000		She opened it to let the pig out.
82.380000	83.990000		A cat was **inside**^[Inside means the inner part, space or side of something.]!
84.750000	85.990000		"He tricked me!
86.230000	87.710000		That isn't **proper**^[If something is proper, it is right.]"
87.930000	88.850000		she said.

89.410000	92.500000		Later, the man returned to trick more people.
93.010000	94.100000		Beth saw him,
94.140000	96.520000		and the **memory**^[A memory is something you remember.] of the cat came back.
97.020000	98.590000		She told her friends.
98.910000	100.030000		They stopped him.
100.400000	103.030000		But no one knew what to do next.

103.610000	104.760000		Someone said,
105.130000	108.970000		"We need an **independent**^[If something is independent, it is not controlled by something else.] and fair person to decide that."
109.530000	111.050000		They went to the judge.
111.430000	113.920000		Beth told him about the cat in the bag.

114.670000	115.870000		The judge asked,
116.320000	117.750000		"Is there **evidence**^[Evidence is a fact or thing that you use to prove something.]?
117.890000	119.920000		Can you **demonstrate**^[To demonstrate something is to show how it is done.] how he did it?"

120.670000	121.990000		"Look in his bag,"
122.260000	123.110000		said Beth.
123.630000	124.640000		She opened it
124.720000	126.800000		and let a cat out of the bag.
127.300000	129.110000		They learned the man's secret,
129.220000	130.850000		and he went to **jail**^[A jail is a place to keep bad people.].

132.060000	133.460000		That's how the idiom
133.550000	135.260000		"let the cat out of the bag"
135.490000	137.880000		**came to**^[Come + to V: Diễn tả sự thay đổi trạng thái hoặc nhận thức dần dần theo thời gian.] mean to tell a secret.
