3.840000	6.520000		Mike was the smallest child in school.
6.860000	8.760000		Another boy, Joe,
8.680000	10.400000		always **teased**^[trêu chọc] Mike.
10.780000	15.550000		Joe had a large **scar**^[vết sẹo] on his face from fighting other children.
15.970000	18.491958		One day, Joe **offended**^[To offend is to make someone angry or upset.] Mike
18.410805	21.981545		when he made fun of Mike's valentine, Jane.
22.230000	23.890000		This was **disgraceful**^[Disgraceful behavior is behavior that is very bad.],
23.930000	26.930000		but Mike didn't know how to make Joe stop.

27.400000	30.460000		That day, Mike walked home down an **alley**^[An alley is a narrow road between houses or buildings.].
30.680000	34.230000		He found a **bunch**^[A bunch is a group of the same things.] of wood boards next to a **pine tree**^[cây thông].
34.630000	36.060000		He thought to himself,
36.340000	39.160000		"I could build a **decent**^[A decent person or thing is OK or good enough.] **sled**^[xe trượt tuyết] from these.
39.370000	41.080000		If I let Joe use it,
41.130000	43.250000		he will be nicer to me and Jane.”
44.300000	45.850000		He took the wood home.

46.330000	49.150000		Mike got an **ax**^[cái rìu] and cut the wood.
49.590000	53.510000		He used nails to make sure that the pieces were not **loose**.
53.920000	55.010000		As he worked,
55.100000	57.450000		he **bumped**^[va, đụng] his **elbow**^[khuỷu tay] on the boards.
57.760000	60.750000		The **painful sensation**^[cảm giác đau đớn] made him want to cry.
61.070000	62.730000		It was a hard **chore**^[A chore is an unpleasant job that must be done.],
62.710000	64.240000		but he **persisted**^[To persist means to keep doing something even when it is hard.].
64.360000	65.840000		He worked overnight.
65.980000	68.520000		By morning, the sled was finished.

69.160000	71.340000		Mike called Joe on the telephone.
71.490000	73.370000		He said, “Hi, Joe.
73.320000	75.620000		Come over to my house right away!"

76.370000	79.580000		Joe didn't know why Mike wanted him to come over.
79.910000	81.370000		When Joe arrived,
81.430000	82.580000		Mike told him,
82.760000	88.280000		"Joe, it **irritated**^[To irritate means to annoy someone.] me the other day when you said mean things about Jane.
88.560000	91.670000		You weren't **kidding**^[To kid is to say something that is not true as a joke.] when you said those mean things.
92.050000	93.840000		But I'm not like you.
94.110000	96.040000		I just built this sled,
96.080000	99.110000		and I'll let you ride it with me if you are nice.”

99.880000	101.480000		They became friends,
101.440000	104.640000		and Joe was **grateful**^[A grateful person feels thankful about something.] that Mike was so nice to him.
104.830000	105.661438		He learned
105.634387	107.866099		that it is more fun to be nice
107.825522	109.140000		than to be mean.
