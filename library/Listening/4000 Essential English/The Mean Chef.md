3.850000	7.310000		Once there was a chef who was mean to his cooks.
7.680000	10.670000		He was mean to the people who came in to eat.
10.900000	13.540000		He charged too much for meals.
13.980000	18.370000		Many people were not able to **afford**^[To afford something means to have enough money to pay for it.] the cheapest **bean**^[A bean is a plant seed that is good to eat.] dish.
18.850000	20.820000		When his **metal**^[Metal is a strong material people use to build things.] **oven**^[lò nướng (lò vi sóng)] broke,
21.060000	23.080000		he did not have it fixed.
23.410000	25.990000		So everything they tried to **bake**^[To bake means to cook food in an oven.] in it
26.000000	26.930000		burned.
27.280000	29.750000		The only light was from **candles**^[A candle is a stick of wax that is lit on fire for light or heat.],
29.870000	32.530000		and the whole place was a mess.
32.890000	35.630000		Sometimes, he didn't pay his waiters.
36.010000	38.060000		Since they had no **funds**^[A fund is an amount of money that people have.],
38.140000	39.950000		they had many **debts**^[A debt is an amount of money that a person owes.].

40.590000	42.650000		The chef behaved this way
42.580000	43.910000		all the time.
44.240000	46.040000		He **monitored**^[To monitor people or things is to watch them closely.] the cooks
46.060000	49.540000		and got angry if they did not do things his way.

50.560000	54.940000		One day, the cooks decided that they were tired of the **abuse**^[To abuse means to hurt someone or something on purpose.]
54.970000	57.980000		and that they would not be **passive**^[A passive person does not take action to solve problems.] anymore.
58.460000	60.710000		Everyone **opposed**^[To oppose something means to dislike it or act against it.] the chef.
61.190000	64.230000		At first, they thought about **suing**^[To sue is to take someone to court for some harmful action.] him.
64.720000	65.790000		Instead,
65.840000	68.190000		they made him sit quietly
68.130000	70.410000		while they controlled the restaurant!
71.080000	73.510000		They **decreased**^[To decrease something is to make it less than it was before.] the price of food.
73.740000	78.670000		They used the best **ingredients**^[An ingredient is something that is part of a food dish.] and served large **quantities**^[A quantity is a certain amount of something.] of food.
79.020000	80.930000		They repaired the equipment.
81.090000	83.000000		They turned on the lights.
83.440000	87.280000		The restaurant was **converted**^[To convert something means to change it into something else.] into a happy place.
87.510000	88.950000		For the first time,
89.050000	91.220000		many people came to eat.

91.850000	93.380000		The chef realized
93.290000	96.480000		that the restaurant's problems were his **fault**^[A fault is responsibility for a mistake.].
96.920000	99.260000		The chef learned an important lesson,
99.400000	104.690000		and now the **generous**^[A generous person likes to give things to people.] chef **insisted**^[To insist means to be firm in telling people what to do.] on giving the customers a free meal.
