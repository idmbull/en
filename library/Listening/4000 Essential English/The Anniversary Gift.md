4.110000	5.880000		Joe was a **carpenter**^[thợ mộc].
5.980000	8.200000		He built houses in the **highlands**^[cao nguyên].
8.520000	10.410000		Joe's wife, Stella,
10.440000	14.280000		used a **needle**^[kim] and **thread**^[chỉ] to **sew**^[may, khâu] **elegant**^[Something elegant is very fancy and pleasing.] clothing.
14.590000	18.060000		She only used beautiful **fabric**^[văn phong trang trọng của cloth ] to make clothes.

18.420000	20.880000		Since they didn't have a lot of money,
20.850000	22.950000		they lived in an old **shed**^[nhà kho].
23.220000	25.510000		Water **dripped**^[dột] in when it rained.
25.760000	28.760000		They had broken chairs instead of a **couch**^[ghế sofa].
29.120000	31.080000		But they had **coal**^[than] for heat,
30.940000	33.180000		and **flour**^[bột mì] from the **mill**^[cối xay] for bread.
33.520000	37.520000		Together, they **trimmed**^[cắt tỉa] the bushes to make their house look nice.
37.830000	39.860000		Joe and Stella were poor,
39.850000	41.360000		but not **ashamed**^[xấu hổ].
41.480000	42.720000		They were happy.

43.210000	45.170000		Sometimes in the evening,
45.040000	46.880000		they walked downtown.
47.080000	49.800000		They looked in store windows and dreamed.
50.120000	53.400000		Stella wanted a hairbrush with an **ivory**^[ngà voi] handle.
53.640000	56.330000		She pulled her hair **upwards**^[hướng lên trên] every day
56.300000	59.900000		because she didn't have a brush to make it nice.
60.360000	63.570000		Joe wanted to fix his grandfather's watch.

64.080000	65.730000		For their **anniversary**^[ngày kỷ niệm],
65.690000	68.720000		Stella wanted to get Joe what he wanted.
69.150000	71.250000		But then she did the **arithmetic**^[Arithmetic is math.].
71.530000	75.500000		It would take at least six months to save enough money.
75.900000	78.160000		Then, she had an idea.
78.350000	81.390000		She cut off all of her hair and sold it.

81.950000	86.120000		Meanwhile, Joe knew that he could never fix his watch.
86.470000	88.970000		So he **polished**^[To polish something is to rub it in order to make it shiny.] it and sold it.
89.180000	91.610000		He made enough to buy the brush.
92.000000	93.630000		On their anniversary,
93.600000	95.480000		the door **burst**^[To burst is to suddenly break open or apart.] open.
96.250000	99.150000		Joe was excited to give Stella his gift.
99.570000	103.680000		But first, Stella gave him the money to fix the watch.
103.960000	106.700000		When he saw his wife without any hair,
106.650000	107.710000		he smiled.
108.040000	110.700000		"I sold my watch to buy you something,"
110.640000	111.790000		Joe said.
111.960000	114.700000		He gave her the brush, and she laughed.
114.970000	118.560000		They were both willing to give up something very special
118.470000	120.240000		to make each other happy.
