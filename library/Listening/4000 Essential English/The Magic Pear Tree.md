3.860000	7.300000		It was a cool morning, and the grass was covered in **mist**^[sương mỏng (fog: sương dày đặc)].
7.610000	9.410000		The market was full of people.
9.860000	12.390000		A mean farmer named Jack yelled,
12.550000	14.010000		"Pears for sale!"
14.670000	18.070000		He sat on a **bench**^[sofa, couch là ghế bech có đệm], **plotting**^[To plot is to make a secret plan to do something that is wrong or mean.] how he could trick people.
18.660000	21.250000		Then, an **orphan**^[trẻ mồ côi] came to his cart.

22.040000	23.770000		"Can you **spare**^[nhường lại, cho đi một thứ gì đó mà bạn đang có dư dôi hoặc không thực sự cần dùng đến ngay lúc này.] a pear?"
23.890000	24.980000		she asked.

25.400000	26.940000		Jack felt **rage**^[Rage is a very angry feeling.].
27.140000	28.210000		He replied,
28.420000	30.060000		"You don't have any money!"
30.750000	33.450000		"Please, I haven't had **supper**^[Dinner] **in days**^[trong nhiều ngày]."
33.830000	34.710000		"No!"
34.860000	36.240000		shouted the farmer.

36.890000	38.430000		The orphan **sighed**^[thở dài].
38.630000	43.160000		However, a **pregnant lady**^[phụ nữ mang thai] heard the **dispute**^[A dispute is an argument or disagreement that people have.] and came over to Jack.
43.760000	45.560000		"Just give her a pear,
45.560000	46.560000		she said.
47.180000	49.810000		Jack had no **shame**^[sự xấu hổ] and said no.
50.420000	53.340000		Finally, a man bought a pear for the girl.

53.980000	57.200000		The girl quickly ate it, but she saved the seed.
57.380000	59.430000		She wanted to **get revenge**^[trả thù].

60.990000	62.480000		She told Jack,
62.820000	66.140000		"I know a way to get hundreds of pears in one day.
66.330000	67.910000		I'll show you how.”

68.730000	70.750000		He watched the girl dig a hole.
71.010000	73.170000		She dropped the seed into the ground.
73.410000	75.580000		Then she **spread**^[phủ] the dirt over it.

76.210000	77.660000		"Watch closely,"
77.620000	78.640000		she said.
79.040000	81.540000		"In a few minutes, a **stem**^[The stem of a plant is the stick that grows leaves or flowers.] will grow.
81.710000	84.580000		It'll turn into a tree that's full of pears!"

85.510000	88.590000		Jack **stared at**^[Nhìn chằm chằm, không chớp mắt.] the dirt, but nothing happened.
89.170000	92.390000		The only objects there were a few **daisies**^[hoa cúc].
92.840000	95.840000		He looked for the girl, but she had **snuck**^[To sneak is to move quietly in order not to be seen or heard.] away.

96.300000	99.200000		Then, he looked at his cart in **horror**^[Horror is a feeling of being very afraid or shocked.].
99.520000	100.800000		It was empty!
101.340000	104.720000		He suddenly realized that the orphan had tricked him.
105.260000	108.070000		While Jack was waiting for the tree to grow,
108.100000	110.900000		the people had taken the pears from his cart.
111.470000	114.650000		They all laughed while they were eating the **tender**^[mềm] fruit.
115.180000	117.070000		The farmer felt **ashamed**^[xấu hổ, ngượng ngùng].
117.430000	120.250000		The **incident**^[An incident is an event that is usually not pleasant.] taught him to be kinder.
