3.970000	6.290000		There was once a small restaurant.
6.440000	10.090000		People said that the best chef in the world worked there.
10.420000	13.870000		But the chef was a **horrible**^[A horrible thing is very bad.] person to work for.
14.140000	15.630000		He was **impolite**^[bất lịch sự]
15.660000	18.800000		and **scolded**^[To scold means to criticize someone angrily for doing something wrong.] his workers all the time.
19.200000	21.750000		The chef had a young **apprentice**^[người học việc].
22.060000	24.500000		The apprentice's first **priority**^[sự ưu tiên]
24.530000	27.470000		was to make the best food in the world.
27.740000	30.280000		He was happy to have a good teacher,
30.380000	32.540000		but he didn't like the chef.
32.910000	35.190000		The boy was a **diligent**^[A diligent person works hard and is careful.] worker,
35.410000	39.700000		but the chef scolded him more than anyone else.

40.520000	41.830000		Then one day,
41.860000	44.160000		the chef got great news.
44.440000	47.900000		The **emperor**^[hoàng đế] wanted to have dinner there that night.
48.170000	50.050000		He was very excited.
50.480000	52.710000		He was working very fast,
52.770000	54.560000		and he made a mistake.
54.900000	56.950000		He cut his hand with a knife,
57.050000	58.990000		and it started to **bleed**^[chảy máu].
59.830000	62.020000		The apprentice gave him a **bandage**^[băng gạc],
62.100000	64.450000		but the chef still couldn't cook.
64.750000	66.750000		The chef started to **panic**^[hoảng loạn].
67.100000	69.850000		The apprentice tried to **assure**^[trấn an] him.
70.150000	72.420000		"Everything will be OK,"
72.440000	73.350000		he said.
73.550000	75.950000		But the chef was still afraid.
76.270000	78.780000		Then they started to work together.
79.050000	80.710000		They began to **bond**^[To bond with someone is to become friends with that person.].
81.050000	83.760000		The chef told the apprentice what to do,
83.810000	86.390000		and the boy cooked a great meal.

87.020000	88.640000		As soon as they finished,
88.710000	90.460000		the emperor arrived.
90.730000	94.460000		He wore a beautiful **robe**^[áo choàng] made of soft **fibers**^[A fiber is a thread of a substance used to make clothes or rope.].
94.670000	97.170000		He also had a **massive**^[A massive thing is very big.] **crown**^[A crown is the hat worn by a king or queen.].
97.510000	101.430000		Everyone in the restaurant **kneeled**^[quỳ gối] when the emperor came in.
101.860000	104.710000		The chef and the boy brought out his food.

105.000000	107.730000		The emperor was used to luxuries.
108.080000	109.620000		Would he like the food?
109.930000	112.590000		The emperor loved the food.
112.890000	114.510000		After his **departure**^[A departure is the act of leaving a place.],
114.510000	116.500000		the chef was very **proud**^[tự hào]
116.510000	119.690000		and very thankful to his new friend,
119.630000	120.870000		the apprentice.
