5.700000	9.650000		Today is the most important day of my life.
9.780000	12.560000		I finally climbed Mt. Everest,
12.410000	15.100000		the tallest mountain in the world.
15.310000	18.150000		My name is Edmund Hillary.

19.050000	21.920000		The top of the mountain was amazing.
22.080000	24.740000		It felt like we were close to heaven.
25.280000	27.670000		The snow was so thick
27.550000	30.140000		that my boots sank into it.
30.460000	32.490000		The air was silent.
32.720000	35.690000		I looked at the beauty that surrounded me.
35.960000	39.620000		Maybe my story will be a legend someday.

40.440000	43.730000		I want people to remember this forever.
44.090000	47.560000		I was the senior explorer in my group,
47.810000	52.360000		and I knew we needed something to show others about our climb.
52.730000	55.580000		I took many pictures with my camera.
55.880000	59.960000		I’ll put them in a frame and hang them on the wall of my house.

60.810000	64.150000		On the mountain, the air was very cold.
64.250000	67.110000		I wrapped my coat around my body.
67.290000	70.310000		I looked over the side of the mountaintop.
70.360000	71.830000		From that angle,
71.760000	75.770000		I saw the border of the clouds touch the rocks below.
76.130000	78.170000		The snow was thick.
78.210000	79.780000		It looked pure.
79.870000	82.650000		There was no sign of modern life.
82.880000	84.940000		Thousands of years ago,
84.910000	87.940000		my ancestors saw the world this way.

88.910000	90.930000		After fifteen minutes,
90.860000	94.110000		I knew it was time to proceed down the mountain.
94.460000	97.500000		The whole team congratulated each other.
97.800000	101.450000		My superior, John Hunt, praised us all.
101.700000	106.090000		I sent messages to my relatives to tell them that I was safe.
106.690000	110.080000		But it was hard to leave the mountain so quickly.
110.260000	114.620000		I wanted to enjoy the incredible sight even longer.
