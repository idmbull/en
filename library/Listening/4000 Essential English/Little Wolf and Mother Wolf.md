4.260000	7.240000		Mother Wolf was a **magnificent**^[tuyệt đẹp] animal.
7.490000	10.460000		She had all the **traits**^[đặc điểm ổn định, lâu dài của một người hoặc sinh vật.] of a **terrific hunter**^[kẻ săn mồi xuất sắc].
10.790000	13.600000		She was very strong and fast.
13.890000	15.530000		She knew how to hide
15.580000	17.970000		and how to **seize**^[vồ lấy] animals.
18.340000	21.850000		Mother Wolf was the forest's **supreme creature**^[sinh vật tối cao].
22.020000	25.360000		Her skills were **evident to**^[rõ ràng, hiển nhiên với] all the other animals.

26.010000	30.670000		Mother Wolf lived in a den^[cái hang] **beneath**^[under] a tree with her **cub**^[A cub is a baby animal, such as a bear or lion.], Little Wolf.
31.110000	32.840000		One morning at **dawn**^[bình minh; sunset],
32.820000	36.130000		Little Wolf and Mother Wolf were eating breakfast.
36.480000	38.340000		Little Wolf looked sad.
38.580000	40.040000		Mother Wolf said,
40.310000	42.070000		"What is wrong, my cub?"

42.530000	43.910000		Little Wolf said,
44.160000	46.620000		"I want to be big like you.
46.820000	48.840000		You can run and **leap**^[To leap means to jump a long distance. (nhảy như con mèo hoặc hổ khi đang săn mồi)]
48.780000	50.420000		better than anyone.
50.590000	53.110000		You can **howl**^[hú] so loudly.
53.430000	55.810000		Being big is a **necessity**^[sự cần thiết],
55.900000	57.640000		and I am so small."

58.400000	59.780000		Mother Wolf said,
60.020000	62.760000		"Don't be **dissatisfied**^[bất mãn] with your size.
62.990000	66.320000		Being small can be very helpful sometimes."

67.030000	70.450000		Just then, rain and **hail**^[mưa đá] began to fall.
70.700000	72.940000		The tree was hit by lightning.
73.130000	75.320000		It fell on the wolves' den.
75.710000	77.480000		Little Wolf was scared.
77.750000	81.690000		The wolves knew that escaping the den was **vital**^[necessary for life.].
82.010000	83.390000		Mother Wolf said,
83.520000	84.570000		"Little Wolf,
84.720000	87.930000		I cannot move the heavy **pile** of branches.
88.140000	90.420000		But you can escape with **ease**^[sự dễ dàng].
90.570000	93.120000		You can get out and find help!"

93.790000	96.290000		Little Wolf crawled out of the den
96.230000	99.250000		and called all the large animals for help.
99.560000	103.100000		They went to the den and pulled away the branches.
103.280000	105.590000		Mother Wolf came out and said,
105.830000	107.280000		"Thank you, Little Wolf!
107.420000	109.200000		You saved my life!”
109.660000	112.200000		She softly **squeezed**^[ôm siết] Little Wolf
112.270000	113.490000		and kissed her.

113.790000	115.300000		Little Wolf smiled.
115.520000	116.560000		She said,
116.630000	120.730000		"Mother, this **outcome**^[An outcome is the end result of an action or event.] has taught me a **profound lesson**^[bài học sâu sắc].
120.860000	122.650000		Even though I'm small,
122.700000	124.490000		I'm still important."
