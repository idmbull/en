4.090000	5.310000		Long ago,
5.280000	9.810000		Osiris was the king of Egypt, and Isis was the queen.
10.190000	13.970000		They controlled the **fertile land**^[vùng đất màu mỡ] by the Nile River.
14.180000	17.970000		They were not only interested in everyday things.
18.190000	20.280000		Because of their intelligence,
20.220000	23.480000		they explored abstract ideas as well.
23.960000	28.490000		Osiris taught the Egyptians how to make **wheels**^[bánh xe] and **furniture**^[đồ nội thất].
28.960000	32.960000		Isis taught them how to make things from **clay**^[đất sét] and **cloth**^[vải].
33.520000	37.220000		The people thought the king and queen **deserved**^[xứng đáng] a gift.
37.510000	41.450000		So they built Osiris and Isis a **pyramid**^[Kim tự tháp].
41.480000	45.860000		Everyone loved Osiris except his brother, Set.
46.020000	48.560000		Set wanted to be king.

49.610000	55.460000		Osiris made his **annual trip**^[chuyến đi hàng năm] around Egypt and led religious events.
55.720000	60.600000		The people gave him beautiful **shells**^[vỏ (sò, ốc…)] and colorful feathers as gifts.

61.420000	63.320000		When Osiris returned,
63.350000	67.840000		Set brought a beautiful wooden box from behind a **curtain**^[rèm (cửa)].

68.680000	71.440000		"If someone fits inside this box,
71.410000	73.510000		I will give it to him or her,
73.720000	75.030000		Set said.

75.820000	77.750000		Osiris got in it.
78.110000	80.180000		It was an **ideal**^[lý tưởng, hoàn hoản] fit!

81.150000	82.190000		Suddenly,
82.190000	85.990000		Set closed the box and threw it into the river.
86.280000	88.410000		"Now, I will be king!"
88.700000	90.080000		Set said.

91.030000	95.890000		The box **washed up**^[trôi dạt] on a foreign **shore**^[bờ sông, bờ biển] after a flood.
96.400000	98.830000		Isis brought his body home
98.810000	101.730000		and **obtained**^[lo liệu: Obtained a grave nghĩa là bà ấy đã phải tìm kiếm, xin phép hoặc bỏ công sức ra để có được một nơi chôn cất tử tế cho chồng.] a **grave**^[ngôi mộ] for him in Egypt.
102.500000	107.660000		The Egyptian gods thought Isis had done something very romantic.
108.900000	110.740000		Because of this love,
110.860000	114.740000		the gods made Osiris the god of the underworld,
114.990000	119.440000		and Osiris returned every spring to help the farmers.
120.390000	121.980000		Even nowadays,
121.980000	125.550000		people say Osiris keeps their crops alive.
