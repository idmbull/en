4.060000	8.580000		A **solitary**^[A solitary thing is lonely or the only one.] rock **roamed**^[To roam means to move around without a plan or purpose.] through the cold **gloom**^[Gloom is a state of almost complete darkness or sadness.] of space.
8.680000	13.000000		It slowly moved through space with a feeling of sadness.
13.370000	16.190000		In the large and beautiful galaxy,
16.170000	18.600000		it was only a tiny rock.
18.810000	21.420000		It felt like as small as an atom.

22.440000	26.720000		On its journeys, it **encountered**^[bắt gặp] many amazing objects.
26.860000	31.010000		It flew by beautiful moons that were covered with **dust**^[bụi].

31.860000	34.660000		"Why can't I be as beautiful as them?"
34.810000	35.840000		it thought.
36.230000	38.770000		The rock passed a large planet.
38.850000	44.000000		The **sphere**^[A sphere is a three-dimensional round shape, like a ball.] was hundreds of times larger than the **breadth**^[width] of the small rock.

44.800000	47.600000		"Why can't I be as large as that?"
47.710000	48.830000		it wondered.

49.610000	52.230000		The rock was filled with **despair**^[sự tuyệt vọng].
52.330000	55.500000		It was surrounded by beauty and greatness,
55.490000	60.120000		yet it was just a small and **ugly**^[xấu xí] **fragment**^[A fragment is a small part of something.] of rock.

61.090000	65.080000		One day, it approached the area of a bright star.

65.990000	67.340000		"What's wrong?"
67.520000	68.840000		the star asked.
69.590000	73.810000		“Oh, I wish I had a higher **status**^[Status is the position of something or someone in relation to others.] in the galaxy.
73.920000	77.720000		All the other objects are so beautiful and large,
77.820000	79.260000		the rock replied.
79.420000	82.080000		“But I'm just an ugly rock."

83.270000	85.740000		The star considered the problem.
85.920000	87.450000		At last, it said,
87.700000	89.950000		"You don't have to worry anymore.
90.020000	91.630000		I think I can help."
92.280000	98.060000		The star **radiated**^[To radiate means to send out energy or heat.] its light brighter and hotter than it had ever done before.
98.540000	100.230000		"Come a little closer,
100.450000	102.500000		the star said to the rock.

102.840000	105.730000		The rock **drifted**^[trôi dạt] closer to the star.
105.860000	110.750000		Suddenly, the ice that was in the rock's tiny holes **melted**^[tan chảy]
110.730000	112.510000		and became gas.
112.570000	116.120000		Then, the gas came out behind the **comet**^[sao chổi]
116.040000	118.220000		to form a **brilliant tail**^[cái đuôi rực rõ].
118.520000	122.120000		The tail shone with all the colors of the **spectrum**^[quang phổ].

122.920000	126.430000		The little rock had become a beautiful comet.
126.530000	128.500000		It looked so amazing.
128.870000	133.170000		It realized that the star helped it change its appearance.
133.800000	134.870000		“Thank you,”
135.020000	141.520000		the comet said and then flew away with its new beautiful tail following behind it
141.460000	143.350000		like a **giant cape**^[áo choàng (superman hay mặc) khổng lồ].
