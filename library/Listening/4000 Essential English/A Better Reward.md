3.780000	6.490000		Jenny **delivered**^[To deliver something is to take it from one place to another.] food for a restaurant.
6.790000	9.050000		She read the newspaper and said,
9.180000	10.340000		“Uh-oh.”
10.650000	12.860000		There was a story about a **thief**^[A thief is someone who quietly takes things that do not belong to them.].
13.290000	14.660000		He **stole**^[To steal is to take something that is not yours.] food,
14.760000	16.710000		and no one had seen him.
17.150000	19.560000		Even the police couldn't catch him.
19.990000	22.170000		Jenny was a little scared.
22.350000	24.630000		She worked close to that area.

25.760000	29.190000		The newspaper **included**^[To include something means to have it as part of a group.] a message from the police:
29.650000	31.920000		"If anything strange **occurs**^[To occur means to happen.],
31.850000	32.960000		call us.
33.130000	35.330000		If you help us catch the thief,
35.460000	37.470000		you'll **earn**^[To earn means to get money for the work you do.] a **reward**^[A reward is something given in exchange for good behavior or work.]."

38.360000	40.250000		Jenny talked to Jim.
40.380000	42.190000		He **managed**^[To manage something means to control or be in charge of it.] the restaurant.
42.710000	44.640000		"Do you know about the thief?"

45.240000	47.010000		"Yes," he said.
47.400000	50.540000		"But he steals more than one person can eat.
50.880000	53.870000		And why haven't the police stopped him yet?
54.170000	55.560000		It's a **mystery**^[A mystery is something that is difficult to understand or explain.].
55.970000	57.300000		If you see him,
57.260000	59.030000		**contact**^[To contact people is to speak or write to them.] the police.
59.180000	60.830000		Don't run after him."

61.890000	64.540000		Jenny drove to a customer's house.
64.620000	68.250000		She left her car and opened the **gate** to the house.
68.530000	71.420000		But then she heard a noise by her car.
71.760000	72.760000		She said,
72.860000	73.690000		"Thief!"
74.060000	75.650000		She wasn't scared.
75.860000	77.630000		She wanted the reward!
77.870000	81.180000		She did the **opposite**^[If A is the opposite of B, A is completely different from B.] of what Jim told her to do.

82.300000	84.070000		"Hey," she said.
84.220000	85.490000		"Get back here!"
85.970000	89.620000		She **set**^[To set something is to put it somewhere.] the food on the ground and ran to her car.
90.310000	93.200000		But the thief had already left with the food.
93.620000	96.390000		Jenny followed a noise around the corner.
96.740000	98.290000		She was **amazed**^[To amaze people is to surprise them very much.].
98.520000	101.350000		She saw a dog and some **puppies**^[chó con].
101.670000	103.610000		They were eating her food!
104.010000	105.410000		They looked thin
105.350000	106.560000		and scared.
107.150000	109.750000		“The **actual**^[Actual means real or true.] thief is just a dog.
110.050000	112.230000		She's feeding her puppies,”
112.220000	113.190000		she said.
113.360000	116.120000		“That's why she steals so much food.”

117.180000	118.770000		Jenny felt bad.
119.060000	122.770000		She tried to **comfort**^[To comfort someone means to make them feel better.] the dogs with another **plate**^[A plate is a flat round thing that you put food on.] of food.
123.120000	125.560000		Then she took them back to the store.
126.000000	128.500000		Everyone there took a puppy home.
128.800000	130.770000		Jenny called the police.
130.990000	133.920000		She told them there was no real thief.

134.950000	138.400000		Jenny didn't do it to **receive**^[To receive something is to get it.] the reward anymore.
138.700000	139.730000		She said,
139.800000	141.440000		"It was just a dog.
141.720000	144.570000		But there's no **charge**^[A charge is the price to pay for something.] for catching this 'thief,'”
144.570000	145.520000		she said.
145.690000	148.590000		“My new dog is a better reward.”
