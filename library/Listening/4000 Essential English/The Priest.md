3.540000	6.450000		A young **priest**^[A priest is a person trained to perform religious duties.] was always sad.
6.770000	8.950000		He was good at his **profession**^[A profession is a person's job.],
9.140000	11.300000		but he still had no **joy**^[Joy is a feeling of great happiness.].
11.740000	13.880000		He visited a group of **monks**^[A monk is a religious person who lives a simple life.].

14.500000	16.660000		When he got to the monks' house,
16.790000	19.070000		they **greeted**^[To greet someone means to meet and welcome that person.] him and let him in.
19.460000	21.790000		The monks asked the priest,
22.120000	23.410000		"What is the matter?”
23.860000	25.230000		The priest said,
25.710000	27.240000		"I should be happy,
27.310000	28.490000		but I am not.
28.700000	30.540000		I don't know what to do.”
31.460000	34.080000		The **wise**^[không ngoan, thông thái] monks **paused**^[To pause means to stop doing something for a while.] for a minute.
34.410000	36.080000		Then, one said,
36.550000	38.800000		“We are **convinced**^[To convince someone means to make that person sure of something.] of your **faith**^[Faith is trust or belief without proof.].
39.270000	41.640000		You are a very good priest.
42.030000	43.670000		But to find joy,
43.720000	45.490000		you have to do more.
45.850000	46.990000		Above all,
47.200000	50.790000		**investigate**^[To investigate means to search for something or learn about it.] the **elements**^[An element of something is a particular part of it.] of your life that you love."
52.200000	55.020000		The priest thought that this answer was **odd**^[Something odd is unusual.],
55.140000	56.770000		but he was **curious**^[A curious person or animals wants to know about something.].

57.470000	58.580000		The next day,
58.700000	61.410000		the priest thought about his **abilities**^[Ability is the quality of a person being able to do something well.].
61.740000	63.480000		He got a few ideas,
63.570000	66.470000		and he did not want to **delay**^[To delay means to wait to do something.] any longer.
67.050000	68.420000		He liked to draw,
68.590000	70.770000		so he made some **cartoons**^[A cartoon is a funny drawing.].
71.120000	72.940000		He also liked to write,
73.150000	75.210000		so he started a **diary**^[A diary is a book in which people write their personal experiences.].
75.720000	77.800000		He was interested in **agriculture**^[Agriculture is the growing of plants and raising of animals for food.],
77.990000	80.080000		so he planted some **grain**^[A grain is a food crop such as wheat, corn, rice, or oats.].
80.510000	82.490000		He made **jam**^[mứt] from fruit.
82.700000	85.840000		He made his own **labels**^[A label is a tag that tells about something.] to put on the **jars of jam**^[lọ mứt].
86.410000	87.950000		He painted his **ceiling**^[The ceiling is the top of a room.].
88.660000	90.740000		The priest learned something.
91.350000	94.520000		It is not too hard to be happy after all.
94.920000	98.590000		All one has to do is find things one likes doing
98.650000	99.720000		and do them!
