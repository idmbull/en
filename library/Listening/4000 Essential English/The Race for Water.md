4.010000	6.610000		There was a town next to a river.
6.740000	9.330000		The people there had a lot of water.
9.500000	11.290000		But they **wasted**^[To waste means to use something carelessly and unnecessarily.] it.
11.480000	13.790000		That made the Sky angry.
14.200000	15.190000		It said,
15.640000	17.500000		"If you waste water,
17.460000	19.530000		I will take it away from you."
20.250000	22.350000		But the people didn't listen.

23.020000	26.380000	When the **season**^[A season is a time of the year	spring, summer, fall, or winter.] changed from spring to summer,
26.520000	28.590000		the clouds **disappeared**^[To disappear means to go away or not be seen.].
28.930000	31.070000		The **bright**^[If something is bright, it gives off a lot of light.] sun was hot
31.080000	32.910000		and made the river dry.
33.580000	35.930000		There was no water **available**^[ If something is available, it means you can get it.].
36.260000	37.580000		People asked,
37.760000	39.810000		"When will the rain fall?"

41.040000	43.220000		The Sky's **response**^[A response is the answer to a question.] was,
43.890000	46.030000		"You don't **appreciate**^[To appreciate something is to understand its good qualities.] water.
46.030000	47.350000		You waste it,
47.300000	50.270000		and now I will never make rain again."

51.310000	54.440000		A boy **decided**^[To decide is to make a definite choice.] that this wasn't **fair**^[Fair means reasonable or right.].
54.880000	56.660000		He **thought of**^[nghĩ ra điều gì đó (kết quả)] a **solution**^[A solution is a way to solve a problem.].
57.140000	59.580000		He asked the Sky to race him.
60.090000	61.020000		He said,
61.450000	65.730000		“If I get to the top of that **hill**^[A hill is a raised area of land. It is higher than the land around it.] before your rain can **form**^[tạo thành] **puddles**^[A puddle is a pool of liquid on the ground.],
65.760000	67.460000		you must fill our river."

68.400000	70.230000		The Sky laughed.
70.410000	73.130000		"Little boy, I am the Sky.
73.100000	75.370000		I am **above**^[giới từ: cao hơn, quan trọng hơn, vượt lên trên] everything **else**^[If you talk about something else, you talk about something different.].
75.430000	77.170000		You cannot **beat**^[To beat someone means to do better than they do.] me."
77.480000	80.160000		But the boy knew he would win.

80.770000	84.290000		When the race began, the boy ran **forward**^[If you move forward, you move in the direction in front of you.].
84.530000	87.150000		The Sky started raining on the hill.
87.410000	89.910000		But puddles did not form there.
90.320000	92.100000		When it rained on the hill,
92.060000	93.740000		the water went down.

94.210000	96.370000		The Sky kept raining.
96.600000	99.520000		The water **flowed**^[To flow is to move easily and continuously in one direction.] down into the river.
99.850000	102.500000		When the boy reached the top of the hill,
102.470000	104.220000		the river was full.
104.540000	107.060000		The people began to **celebrate**^[To celebrate is to do something to show that an event is special.].
107.250000	111.770000		It was the highest **level**^[A level is a point on a scale that measures something.] the river had ever been at before.

112.760000	114.690000		The Sky was angry.
115.590000	117.600000		"A boy can't beat me!
117.720000	119.820000		I won't fill your river,
120.240000	121.260000		it said.
121.720000	123.770000		Now the boy laughed.
124.220000	127.750000		“It doesn't matter **whether**^[You use whether when you must choose between two things.] you want to fill it or not,”
127.830000	128.840000		he said.
128.920000	130.570000		“You already did.”
131.480000	134.150000		The Sky looked at the full river.

134.450000	135.850000		"You tricked me,"
136.010000	137.030000		it said.
137.570000	139.180000		It asked the people,
139.690000	142.020000		"Do you appreciate water now?"

142.700000	143.840000		"Yes,"
143.940000	145.060000		they said.
145.300000	147.220000		"We won't waste it."

148.220000	152.120000		That is how a **lone**^[A lone person or thing is the only one in a given place.] boy saved his town
152.030000	154.480000		and won the race for water.
