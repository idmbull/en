3.390000	5.110000		Once, there were two ships.
5.200000	7.090000		Both ships carried cotton.
7.340000	9.200000		The captains were very different.
9.350000	10.920000		Thomas was strict.
11.030000	14.050000		He made his crew **engage**^[To engage in something means to do it.] in difficult tasks,
14.120000	17.100000		and he kept **firm control**^[Sự kiểm soát chặt chẽ nhưng hợp lý] of his ship and men.
17.550000	20.790000		His ship's **deck**^[boong tàu] was always clean and working well
20.830000	23.660000		and he sailed carefully to use less **fuel**^[nguyên liệu].
24.090000	25.890000		His ship was very **plain**^[A plain thing is simple and not decorated.],
25.960000	28.220000		but he never had a problem with it.

29.160000	31.280000		The second captain, William,
31.200000	32.790000		was not so serious.
32.910000	34.680000		He had a **grand**^[Something grand is big and liked by people.] ship,
34.610000	36.390000		and he loved having fun.
36.690000	38.390000		When they stopped at islands,
38.360000	42.590000		his crew **amused**^[To amuse someone means to do something that is funny or entertaining.] themselves by going **surfing**^[lướt sóng] or diving on the **reef**^[rạn đá / rạn san hô].
43.110000	46.980000		They gave more time to these things than to taking care of the ship.

47.760000	50.460000		One day, Thomas saw a **hurricane**^[A hurricane is a bad storm that happens over the ocean.] ahead.
50.790000	53.630000		He knew that his ship needed to turn around.
53.870000	56.690000		But he was sure William did not see the storm.
57.140000	59.360000		He **adjusted**^[To adjust something means to change it so it is better.] the **dials**^[núm vặn] on the radio
59.300000	63.000000		and called his friend to tell him how to avoid the danger **zone**^[A zone is an area that has different qualities from the ones around it.].
63.460000	65.900000		But William's radio was not working,
65.960000	68.680000		so it was not possible to contact him.
69.110000	71.610000		When William's ship got to the hurricane,
71.640000	73.710000		the wind blew it into the **reef**^[A reef is a group of rocks or coral in the ocean.].

74.750000	76.740000		William tried to **shut**^[To shut something means to close it tightly.] the door,
76.650000	79.410000		but the ship had already **crashed**^[To crash means to hit and break something.] into the **coral**^[Coral is the hard, colorful material formed by the shells of animals.],
79.440000	81.260000		and there was a lot of damage.
81.470000	84.960000		William's crew then **accused**^[To accuse someone of something is to blame them for doing it.] him of being a bad captain.
85.230000	87.780000		The **loss**^[A loss is the act or instance of losing something.] of the ship taught William a lesson,
87.830000	92.500000		and he then really understood the value of keeping equipment working well.
