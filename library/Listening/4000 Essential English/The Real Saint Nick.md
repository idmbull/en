3.650000	8.560000		At Christmas, children wait for Saint Nicholas to bring gifts down the **chimney**^[ống khói].
8.830000	10.610000		But it's not just a story.
10.670000	13.190000		Saint Nicholas was a real person.

13.790000	18.880000		A long time ago, a man named Marcus **occupied**^[To occupy a place is to live, work, or be there. ] a house with his family.
19.290000	21.040000		He was not **modest**^[khiêm tốt (biểu hiện ra bên ngoài)].
21.260000	23.280000		He always told everybody
23.150000	26.160000		he was the strongest man in the province.

26.570000	27.900000		He worked hard,
27.760000	30.580000		but he could barely **sustain**^[To sustain something is to keep it going.] his family.
30.960000	33.730000		He wanted to save money and **prosper**^[To prosper is to be successful or make a lot of money.].
34.010000	37.720000		Still, he could never earn a **penny**^[A penny is a coin worth one cent.] more than he needed.

38.370000	41.940000		One day, Marcus **made an agreement**^[thỏa thuận] with a **blacksmith**^[thợ rèn].
42.380000	44.960000		The blacksmith had a lot of work to do,
45.000000	47.420000		but he couldn't do it all by himself.
47.940000	50.720000		Marcus wanted to help him **forge iron**^[rèn sắt].
51.120000	54.850000		The blacksmith agreed to **compensate**^[To compensate is to pay someone for the time they spent doing something.] him with a lot of money.

55.400000	58.630000		In the same town, there was a man named Nicholas.
58.920000	62.380000		At an early age, Nicholas started **preaching**^[giảng đạo].
62.700000	65.590000		But he also believed that he should be **humble**^[khiêm nhường (nội tâm bên trong)]
65.460000	66.530000		and helpful.
66.930000	72.030000		He learned that helping people gave him even more **satisfaction**^[sự hài lòng] than preaching.

72.540000	75.310000		One day, Nicholas **encountered**^[To encounter is to find or meet a person or thing.] Marcus.
75.500000	79.230000		Marcus told Nicholas about his agreement with the blacksmith.
79.780000	81.500000		"I worked hard for him,"
81.430000	82.670000		Marcus said,
82.730000	84.470000		"but a problem **arose**^[phát sinh].
84.600000	86.680000		Even though I worked for him,
86.670000	88.150000		he didn't pay me."

88.800000	91.220000		Nicholas wanted to help Marcus.
91.380000	92.450000		That night,
92.450000	94.790000		he went back to Marcus's house.
95.070000	96.740000		He brought a bag of gold.
97.040000	99.610000		It **exceeded**^[vượt quá] the amount that Marcus needed.
99.990000	104.550000		Nicholas climbed up a ladder and dropped the bag of gold down the chimney.
104.920000	107.130000		Marcus thanked his **benefactor**^[A benefactor is a person who gives money to help someone.].

107.610000	110.910000		Soon, people found out about Nicholas's gift.
111.440000	113.810000		He became well known and loved.
113.960000	115.230000		Even today,
115.120000	118.030000		people still give secret gifts to children.
118.080000	120.980000		And we say they are from Saint Nicholas.
