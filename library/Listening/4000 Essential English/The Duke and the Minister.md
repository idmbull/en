4.190000	6.910000		A mean **duke**^[công tước] grew **tobacco**^[cây thuốc lá].
7.020000	10.490000		The duke's top **minister**^[A minister is an important person in government with many duties.] was his **twin brother**^[em song sinh].
10.680000	13.070000		They **resembled**^[To resemble someone is to look like that person.] each other a lot.
13.110000	16.710000		One day, the tobacco plants started to die.
16.970000	23.310000		The duke hired men to watch the fields so they could see who was damaging the plants.
23.440000	27.040000		Soon, the men brought a woman to him and said,
27.530000	29.320000		"We captured a **witch**^[phù thủy]!"

30.240000	31.620000		The duke asked,
31.870000	33.130000		"How do you know?"

33.810000	35.860000		“She sang magic words.
35.870000	37.510000		I can't pronounce them.
37.600000	39.160000		She has **cursed**^[nguyền rủa] us.
39.310000	42.610000		The death of the plants is a **symptom**^[A symptom of a bad condition or illness is a sign that it is happening.] of her curse,”
42.970000	44.360000		the men said.

45.330000	47.780000		"I am just an **ordinary**^[Ordinary means normal, or not special in any way.] woman.
47.910000	51.000000		I was singing a song in a different language,"
51.290000	52.640000		the woman said.

53.150000	54.950000		The duke didn't listen.
55.380000	56.610000		“You are **guilty**^[Guilty people feel bad for something they did.].
56.580000	58.020000		You will go to jail,"
58.210000	59.130000		he said.

59.910000	62.860000		The minister thought that she was **innocent**^[An innocent person is not guilty of a crime.].
63.000000	65.400000		He needed to **expose**^[To expose is to make known something that is hidden.] the **truth**^[sự thật].
65.720000	69.680000		The minister went to find out what was happening to the plants.
70.120000	73.510000		He saw hundreds of small bugs eating them!
73.810000	78.620000		Then, the minister went to the jail and did something **bold**^[A bold person is not afraid of doing something.].

79.470000	81.300000		"Let this woman go,"
81.620000	82.600000		he said.

83.540000	86.110000		The guards thought he was the duke.
86.190000	87.590000		They let her go.
88.020000	90.130000		The minister said to the woman,
90.430000	92.480000		"I **owe**^[nợ] you an **apology**^[lời xin lỗi]."

93.330000	94.420000		"Thank you.
94.690000	97.670000		I thought my stay in jail would be **permanent**^[Something permanent lasts for a long time or forever.],”
97.890000	99.430000		the woman answered.
100.350000	103.330000		The minister thought the duke would punish him.
103.440000	104.850000		But he didn't.
104.980000	108.990000		The duke was too busy trying to **preserve**^[To preserve is to protect something from harm.] his plants.
