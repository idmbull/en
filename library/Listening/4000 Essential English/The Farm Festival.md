3.780000	5.200000		Once there was a farm.
5.260000	7.130000		Many animals lived there.
7.360000	9.970000		One day, they had a **contest**^[A contest is a game or a race.] in the **yard**^[A yard is the ground just outside of a house.].
10.290000	13.960000		They were going to race from the barn to the farmer's garage.
14.160000	16.780000		The **barn**^[chuồng gia súc] and the **garage**^[A garage is the part of a house where people put their cars.] were far apart.
16.940000	18.600000		It would be a long race.
18.870000	23.010000		The winner **qualified**^[To qualify is to have or do things that are needed for something.] to win a bag full of apples as an **award**^[An award is a prize for doing something well.].

23.780000	26.090000		But the race did not start well.
26.390000	29.120000		The cart with all the apples was not **stable**^[A stable thing will not move, change, or fall over.],
29.150000	31.170000		and the animals had to **repair**^[To repair something is to fix it.] it.
31.510000	34.510000		Then, the **pup**^[A pup is a young dog.] **knocked over**^[làm đổ] the apples.
34.870000	35.900000		The pig said,
36.110000	37.500000		"We are going to **slip**^[To slip means to slide and fall down.]!
37.530000	39.420000		We must clean up this mess."
39.830000	41.350000		The pup felt bad,
41.370000	43.150000		and she began to cry.
43.520000	46.370000		The dog gave her a **tissue**^[A tissue is a soft piece of paper people use to wipe their noses.] to dry her **tears**^[nước mắt].

47.140000	48.860000		Then, the race **resumed**^[To resume something means to start it again after taking a break.].
49.230000	53.000000		But the duck tried to **rob**^[To rob is to take property by using force.] them and take all the apples.
53.400000	54.530000		The cat said,
54.640000	56.270000		"I will have you **arrested**^[To arrest someone means to catch that person for doing something bad.]!"
56.560000	57.690000		The duck said,
57.760000	59.420000		"You can't **convict**^[To convict means to prove that someone did a bad thing.] me!
59.430000	61.250000		You can't prove I took them."
61.570000	63.900000		The race stopped yet again.

64.760000	67.450000		The animals tried to race one more time.
67.750000	70.770000		Then, they heard an **alarm**^[An alarm is something that warns people of danger.] coming from the barn.
71.010000	72.360000		There was a fire!
73.210000	75.930000		They got **buckets**^[A bucket is a round container to put things in.] of water to put out the fire.
76.270000	80.320000		A **journalist**^[A journalist is a person who writes news stories.] came to write a story about the **festival**^[A festival is an event that is held to celebrate a particular thing.] and the race.
80.680000	82.010000		The horse told her,
82.120000	84.140000		"I am a special **breed**^[A breed is a group of animals within a species.] of horse.
84.160000	86.170000		I would have won the race easily.”
86.700000	87.820000		The pig said,
87.950000	90.290000		"It was **somewhat**^[Somewhat means to some degree, but not to a large degree.] hard to have the race.
90.320000	91.610000		But we had fun.
91.710000	93.410000		That is what's important!"
