4.200000	7.100000		Tim was the strongest man in the town.
7.400000	10.600000		When he played sports, he always won.
11.020000	14.330000		He **performed**^[To perform is to do something in front of people who watch.] and **exercised**^[To exercise is to run or play sports so that you can be healthy.] in the **public**^[If something is public, it is meant for everyone to use.] park.
14.860000	18.450000		He did this to show everyone how strong he was.
18.850000	20.540000		Most people liked him,
20.700000	22.670000		but one man didn't.
22.780000	24.800000		His name was Jack.

25.820000	27.920000		Jack hated Tim.
28.360000	30.230000		Jack was a movie **critic**^[A critic is someone who gives opinions about movies, books, plays, etc.]
30.360000	32.820000		and the smartest man in town.
33.200000	36.130000		He could solve **complex**^[If something is complex, it has many small parts. It is hard to understand.] math problems.
36.310000	37.890000		But no one cared.
38.260000	41.120000		Jack wanted to be famous like Tim.

42.310000	45.300000		One day, there was an unusual **event**^[An event is something that happens, especially something important.].
45.810000	48.430000		A big **storm**^[bão] came suddenly.
48.770000	51.060000		The town was **buried**^[When you bury something, you put it under the ground or under a lot of other things.] in snow.
51.390000	53.170000		No one could get out.
53.490000	54.920000		They needed food.
55.350000	56.630000		The people said,
57.070000	59.690000		"This is a task for a strong man."
60.330000	62.790000		Tim was under **pressure**^[Pressure is what you apply to make someone do something.] to save them.
63.260000	65.420000		But Jack wanted to be a hero,
65.600000	67.340000		so they both went.
67.840000	68.950000		Tim said,
69.200000	72.700000		“You can't help because of your **lack**^[If there is a lack of something, there is not enough of it.] of strength.”

73.500000	76.680000		But Jack knew the local area very well
76.930000	81.080000		and could find paths that were usable **despite**^[Despite + Noun (Bất chấp / Mặc dù)] the snow.
81.560000	84.540000		They led in the **direction**^[A direction is the way to go.] of another town.
84.920000	86.760000		That town had food.
87.180000	90.720000		They walked until there was a **block**^[A block is a solid piece of wood, stone, or ice.] of ice in their way.
91.240000	92.300000		Jack said,
92.740000	94.490000		“We can't get past it.
94.900000	97.830000		But if you strike it, it might break."
99.080000	101.910000		Tim knew he **probably**^[If something will probably happen, it is likely to happen.] had enough strength,
102.200000	104.700000		so he struck it, with a hammer.
104.970000	106.020000		It broke.

106.470000	108.730000		When there were more blocks of ice,
108.820000	110.290000		Tim broke them.
110.650000	112.290000		That made him tired.
112.570000	114.670000		He couldn't walk anymore.
115.100000	116.230000		Jack said,
116.400000	119.190000		“Let's **unite**^[To unite is to get together to do something.] and **support**^[To support something is to like it and help it be successful.] each other.
119.530000	121.310000		I'll get the food alone.
121.350000	122.700000		You rest here."

123.250000	125.340000		Jack came back with food.
125.610000	128.660000		Tim couldn't remember which path led home.
128.940000	131.350000		He needed Jack to be his **guide**^[A guide is someone who shows you where to go.].
131.660000	135.180000		The men became friends by working together.

136.320000	137.440000		In town,
137.440000	140.780000		people saw Jack with the food and **cheered**^[To cheer is to give a loud shout of approval or encouragement.].
141.050000	143.190000		They called Jack a hero.
143.470000	145.210000		But Jack didn't care.
145.420000	147.760000		He was thinking of something else.
147.900000	149.360000		He said to Tim,
149.730000	151.470000		"I thought I was **smart**^[Smart means intelligent.],
151.640000	153.940000		but I learned a new **term**^[A term is a word for something.] today:
154.250000	155.390000		**friendship**^[Friendship is the relationship between people who are friends.]."
