3.890000	7.060000		Sue left her **dormitory**^[A dormitory is a school building where students live.] early that morning.
7.300000	10.610000		She had even washed her **uniform**^[A uniform is a piece of clothing worn by people of the same group.] the night before.
10.880000	13.430000		She wanted to look nice for the day.

14.430000	16.380000		Sue was **committed**^[To commit to something is to promise to do it.] to learning,
16.540000	19.840000		and she had a **talent**^[A talent is a natural ability to do something well.] for getting good grades.
20.330000	21.340000		In fact,
21.390000	23.340000		Sue didn't sleep much.
23.850000	25.970000		She **calculated**^[To calculate is to find an answer using math.], however,
26.130000	30.020000		that she only had enough time for a few hours of sleep.
30.530000	32.440000		She **composed**^[To compose something is to make it from smaller parts.] a paper
32.490000	37.100000		and did some work on her **thesis**^[A thesis is an idea that needs to be proved.] about the importance of **greenhouses**^[A greenhouse is a small glass building that is used to grow plants.].
37.560000	40.380000		She also studied for her **physics**^[Physics is a science that deals with energy and how it affects things.] test.
40.820000	43.090000		Sue was already tired.

43.980000	45.310000		During the test,
45.500000	46.820000		she felt sick.
47.370000	49.080000		Her face got hot,
49.290000	52.380000		and her **vision**^[Vision is the ability to see.] began to become unclear.
52.810000	55.080000		She was **blind**^[A blind person or animal cannot see.] for a moment.
55.670000	58.500000		The teacher saw Sue's **apparent**^[Apparent means clear or easy to see.] problem.
58.850000	61.280000		He wanted to send her to the nurse,
61.340000	63.070000		but she wouldn't go.
63.550000	66.810000		Sue still had a **portion**^[A portion of something is a part of it.] of the test to finish.

67.510000	68.630000		After that,
68.730000	70.520000		Sue went to the nurse.
70.980000	74.030000		After seeing the **secretary**^[A secretary is a person who works in an office.], she waited.
74.400000	75.950000		A few minutes later,
76.010000	78.780000		the nurse came in with a glass of juice
78.830000	81.410000		and told Sue they needed to **chat**^[To chat is to talk with someone.].
82.180000	85.640000		"It is **obvious**^[Obvious means clear or easy to see.] that you have **exhausted**^[To exhaust someone is to make that person tired.] yourself,"
85.840000	87.080000		the nurse said.
87.360000	89.880000		"If you keep working so hard,
89.960000	92.140000		it could have **severe**^[Severe means very bad or serious.] results."

93.020000	95.710000		"My parents tell me that all the time.
96.010000	98.240000		I guess I shouldn't **ignore**^[To ignore something is to act like you do not see or hear it.] them,"
98.490000	99.550000		Sue said.

100.330000	104.510000		"You have to **remind**^[To remind is to tell someone to remember to do something.] yourself that it is OK to rest,"
104.610000	105.750000		the nurse said.
106.250000	108.390000		When Sue got back to her room,
108.490000	110.400000		she went right to bed.
110.670000	115.020000		She made sure she got enough rest every night after that.
