3.760000	7.520000		A dog saw a group of animals **across**^[To go across something is to go to the other side of it.] the road.
7.630000	9.660000		He walked over to meet them.

10.740000	12.260000		"What are you doing?"
12.490000	13.610000		he asked them.

14.360000	18.620000		"I **just**^[vừa mới] sold them tickets to a **race**^[A race is a contest to see who is the fastest.] between the rabbit and the turtle,"
18.780000	20.530000		the duck **responded**^[To respond is to give an answer to what someone else said.].

21.090000	23.970000		The dog was **extremely**^[If something is extremely good, it is very, very good.] **excited**^[To excite someone means to make them happy and interested.].
24.120000	27.190000		He felt **fortunate**^[If you are fortunate, you are lucky.] that he **happened**^[If someone happens to do something, he or she does it by chance.] to be there.
27.820000	29.900000		"I don't have anything to do today,"
30.000000	31.350000		the dog said.
31.490000	33.660000		"I want to buy a ticket, too.”

33.980000	37.240000		The dog sat down to **observe**^[To observe something is to watch it.] the race.
37.460000	40.260000		It would be many kilometers in **length**^[The length of something is how long it is from one end to the other.].
40.570000	43.970000		The rabbit and the turtle stood next to each other.
44.130000	46.600000		They waited for the race to start.
46.920000	51.860000		The dog **wondered**^[To wonder is to ask yourself questions or have a need to know.] why the turtle agreed to run against the rabbit.
52.520000	53.890000		Being fast
53.830000	56.620000		was not a **characteristic**^[A characteristic is something that shows what a person or a thing is like.] of turtles.
56.850000	59.570000		The rabbit was going to win easily.

60.670000	63.070000		Suddenly, the race began.
63.280000	66.300000		The rabbit ran extremely quickly.
66.620000	68.880000		The turtle walked slowly.
69.410000	70.730000		After a minute,
70.720000	72.710000		the rabbit looked back.
72.980000	76.250000		He saw that the turtle was far behind him
76.220000	78.090000		and was **breathing**^[To breathe means to let air go in and out of your body.] quickly
78.020000	80.250000		because he was so tired.
80.700000	82.490000		The rabbit smiled
82.660000	85.170000		and slowed down to a walk.

86.080000	88.650000		A minute later, the rabbit said,
88.940000	91.480000		"I'm winning, so I'll take a rest.”
91.840000	95.320000		He sat and began to **consume**^[To consume something means to eat or drink it.] some grass.
95.560000	98.140000		Then, he **let**^[cho phép / để cho] his eyes close.
98.530000	100.810000		He wasn't the winner **yet**^[Yet is used to say something has not happened up to now.].
101.020000	104.340000		But there was no **risk**^[A risk is a chance of something bad happening.] of him losing the race.
104.450000	106.030000		He went to sleep.

107.240000	108.560000		Hours later,
108.630000	110.800000		a loud sound woke him.
111.340000	115.830000		All of the animals were talking loudly and looking at the **field**^[cách đồng].
116.350000	118.970000		He felt **fear**^[Fear is the feeling of being afraid.] **for the first time**^[lần đầu tiên].
119.350000	122.260000		The turtle was almost at the finish line.
122.690000	126.060000		Now, the rabbit **realized**^[To realize is to suddenly understand.] his **mistake**^[A mistake is something you do wrong.].
126.520000	128.480000		But the race was **over**^[(adj) kết thúc, chấm dứt].
128.870000	132.240000		He gave the turtle an **opportunity**^[An opportunity is a chance to do something.] to win,
132.240000	134.030000		and the turtle took it.
134.580000	137.550000		The duck **handed**^[trao, đưa] the turtle his **prize**^[A prize is something of value that is given to the winner.].
137.710000	141.010000		It was the happiest day of the turtle's life.

141.810000	144.430000		The dog was happy for the turtle.
145.530000	147.100000		“He isn't fast,”
147.300000	148.810000		the dog thought.
149.030000	152.710000		“But he **tried his best**^[try + one’s best = nỗ lực tối đa khả năng] and did something great."
