4.470000	6.610000		Once, there was a **shepherd**^[người chăn cừu].
6.820000	9.900000		Every night, he **gathered**^[Thu thập người hoặc vật về một chỗ.(gather data: thu thập dữ liệu)] and counted his sheep.
10.380000	13.300000		He made sure never to **overlook**^[bỏ sót] any of them.
13.770000	17.630000		One night, he saw some wild sheep had joined his **herd**^[đàn (cừu)].
18.050000	20.380000		He hoped to **acquire**^[Có được (qua mua bán, đầu tư, thâu tóm)] the **newcomers**^[A newcomer is a person who has recently arrived at a place or a group.].

21.030000	22.760000		It snowed that night.
23.320000	27.190000		In the morning, the shepherd couldn't take his sheep out of his **lodge**.
27.530000	30.480000		Instead, he had to **feed**^[cho ăn] them inside.
30.890000	33.790000		He gave a small amount of **wheat**^[lúa mì] to his own sheep.
33.840000	36.580000		But he gave more of the food to the wild sheep.
37.140000	40.440000		He thought the extra wheat would **discourage**^[To discourage is to make someone feel less excited about something.] them from leaving.

41.110000	43.060000		It snowed for several days.
43.250000	46.760000		During that time, the shepherd's sheep ate very little.
47.160000	49.900000		The wild sheep, however, ate very well.
50.570000	53.990000		At last, the snow melted, and they **ventured**^[To venture is to go to a place that may be dangerous.] outdoors.
54.490000	56.734764		As soon as he opened the door of his **hut**^[A hut is a house made of wood, grass, or mud that has only one or two rooms.],
56.704958	59.000000		the wild sheep started to run away.

59.550000	62.220000		"Wait! This is how you repay me?
62.290000	64.510000		After I **treated**^[đối xử] you so kindly,
64.450000	66.120000		why do you run away?"
66.330000	67.680000		the shepherd asked.
68.220000	70.340000		His voice was full of **hatred**^[Hatred is a strong feeling of not liking someone or something.].
70.900000	72.629588		The wild sheep stopped
72.570576	74.370000		and turned toward the shepherd.

75.170000	78.640000		"We're leaving because you fed us better than your own sheep,"
78.800000	80.800000		one of the wild sheep replied.
81.240000	84.540000		"You tried to **deceive**^[To deceive is to make someone believe something that is not true.] us with your **ridiculous**^[A ridiculous thing is silly or strange.] plan.
84.800000	87.460000		Yesterday, you treated us kindly,
87.460000	89.580000		but tomorrow you might be different.
90.080000	92.470000		If more wild sheep joined your herd,
92.410000	95.160000		you would treat us as **inferior**^[An inferior thing is not as good as something else.] sheep."

95.810000	97.800000		As the wild sheep ran away,
97.690000	99.960000		the shepherd understood his **offense**^[An offense is behavior that is wrong or breaks a law.].
100.540000	104.110000		He knew this **awkward**^[An awkward thing is embarrassing and uncomfortable.] situation was his own fault.
104.630000	107.490000		He had not been a **satisfactory**^[A satisfactory thing is good enough.] **caretaker**^[A caretaker is a person who takes care of very young, old, or sick people.].
108.180000	110.590000		He was a fake friend to the wild sheep.
111.130000	112.420000		Because of this,
112.310000	114.490000		he had **neglected**^[To neglect someone or something is to not take care of it properly.] his own sheep.
