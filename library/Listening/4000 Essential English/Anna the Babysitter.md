3.890000	6.180000		Since her parents **got a divorce**^[ly hôn],
6.100000	8.220000		Anna has had to help her mother.
8.650000	10.420000		In her mother's **absence**^[không có mặt],
10.480000	13.250000		Anna takes care of Grace, the baby.
13.540000	17.060000		At first, Anna thought it was an easy job.

17.790000	20.700000		One afternoon, Anna played with Grace.
20.860000	22.820000		She meowed like a cat,
22.880000	24.970000		and Grace **imitated**^[bắt chước] her.
25.250000	26.200000		In fact,
26.260000	29.980000		Grace **reproduced**^[To reproduce is to make something exactly how someone else did it.] every sound that Anna made.
30.470000	32.960000		Anna then took her sister outside.
33.250000	35.180000		She put Grace in the **wagon**^[xe đẩy],
35.390000	37.770000		but there was **nowhere** for them to go.
37.950000	39.950000		So they went back inside.

40.420000	44.310000		Anna put the **infant**^[An infant is a baby.] on the floor and went into her room.
44.620000	46.420000		But when she came back,
46.540000	48.440000		Grace had **vanished**^[To vanish is to go away suddenly.]!
48.740000	50.330000		Anna looked everywhere,
50.380000	52.650000		but she could not find her sister.
52.840000	55.560000		Maybe the baby had been **kidnapped**^[bắt cóc]!
56.070000	57.180000		"Where are you?”
57.270000	58.970000		Anna **called aloud**^[gọi to].

59.170000	62.220000		The situation was becoming **urgent**^[An urgent thing is important and needs to be done now.].
62.550000	64.770000		She wanted to call her mom,
64.950000	69.190000		but she didn't want her to think Anna couldn't do the job.
69.650000	71.060000		Anna sat down.
71.320000	73.260000		What was she going to do?
74.120000	76.530000		But then, Anna heard something.
76.780000	78.830000		It was coming from her room.
79.330000	80.310000		"Grace?"
80.620000	84.360000		She **got down on her knees**^[Hạ người xuống trên hai đầu gối] and looked under the bed.
84.600000	87.300000		She could see Grace's **bald**^[A bald person or animal has no hair.] head.
87.530000	90.470000		Grace had followed Anna into her room
90.400000	92.440000		and **crept**^[To creep is to move quietly and slowly.] under the bed.

92.980000	94.500000		"What a **relief**^[Relief is a good feeling after something bad or challenging ends.]!"
94.700000	95.850000		Anna cried.
96.020000	99.390000		She picked up her sister and **patted**^[To pat something is to hit it softly with your hand.] her on the head.
99.740000	101.190000		Her head was soft
101.150000	102.850000		and had no **wrinkles**^[A wrinkle is a line on a person's face that appears as they get old.].
103.210000	105.370000		Grace was **sucking**^[mút (tay)] on her **thumb**^[ngón tay cái]
105.340000	106.600000		and looked tired.
106.880000	109.500000		So, Anna wrapped her in a **blanket**^[cái chăn]
109.410000	111.070000		and sang **rhymes**^[A rhyme is writing or speech that has words with the same ending sounds.] for her.
111.410000	114.310000		Then, she put Grace in bed for a **nap**^[A nap is a short sleep, usually during the day.].

114.780000	116.490000		After that afternoon,
116.530000	120.590000		Anna knew that taking care of Grace was not an easy job.
120.790000	123.740000		It is a lot of work to take care of a baby!
