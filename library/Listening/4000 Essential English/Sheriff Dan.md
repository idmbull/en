3.520000	6.580000		Dan was the evil **sheriff**^[cảnh sát trưởng] of Oceantown.
6.970000	9.270000		Dan was as cruel as the devil.
9.580000	11.180000		He **worshipped**^[tôn sùng] money.
11.790000	16.350000		Dan was a **millionaire**^[triệu phú], but he paid his police officers almost nothing.
16.920000	18.870000		The police were very **bitter**^[A bitter person feels upset or angry about something.],
18.820000	20.590000		but Dan didn't care.
20.890000	22.960000		He only cared about his money.

23.960000	27.510000		Every person who **inhabited**^[To inhabit means to live in a certain place.] Oceantown disliked him.
28.000000	30.120000		Dan **enforced**^[thi hành] cruel laws.
30.510000	36.230000		Once, Dan even put his own brother in jail for throwing a coin into a **fountain**^[đài phun nước]!
36.870000	37.970000		Sometimes,
37.910000	41.250000		he pointed his gun into the air and pulled the trigger.
41.960000	44.500000		He didn't want the **bullets**^[viên đạn] to hit anyone.
44.970000	48.270000		He just wanted to **scare people**^[dọa mọi người] with the loud sound.

49.360000	54.810000		Finally, the people of Oceantown decided that they had to get rid of Sheriff Dan,
54.890000	57.440000		and tried to find some way to do this.
58.290000	62.030000		Their wish to get rid of Dan helped to **unify**^[To unify means to bring people or things together.] the town.
62.760000	64.720000		They **marched**^[To march means to walk at a steady pace together with others.] to Dan's house.
65.220000	68.320000		He was **startled**^[To startle means to scare someone suddenly.] by the sight when he ran to the door.
69.010000	70.540000		When he opened the door,
70.450000	72.190000		the crowd jumped on him.
72.760000	75.360000		They used a rope to tie him to a chair.
75.910000	77.070000		Dan yelled,
77.120000	78.870000		"Get your hands off me!
78.830000	81.860000		I'll put you all in jail for the rest of your lives!"

82.760000	84.690000		The crowd didn't listen.
85.090000	88.640000		They carried Dan to the **harbor**^[bến cảng] and put him aboard a **vessel**^[A vessel is a large ship or boat.].
89.210000	91.970000		Dan was so scared that he began to **sweat**^[đổ mồ hôi].
92.340000	93.320000		He **begged**^[van xin],
93.660000	95.090000		"If you let me go,
95.070000	96.950000		I will give you all my money!"
97.550000	98.790000		The crowd said,
98.900000	101.800000		"Sheriff, we don't care about your money.
101.870000	103.940000		We know you will never change.
104.170000	107.930000		We're sending you on a **voyage**^[A voyage is a long journey made on a boat or an aircraft.] to the middle of the ocean."
108.740000	110.890000		The boat **drifted**^[To drift means to be moved slowly by wind or water.] out of the port,
110.820000	112.900000		and Dan was never seen again.
113.360000	115.340000		The people chose a new sheriff,
115.260000	116.970000		who was kind and fair.
