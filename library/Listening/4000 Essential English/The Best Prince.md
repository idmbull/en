4.170000	6.900000		King Minos was **very sick**^[ốm nặng].
7.000000	9.410000		His condition was **getting worse**^[trở nên tệ hơn].
9.630000	11.490000		He had three sons.
11.640000	13.270000		He loved them all.
13.630000	16.650000		He had to **announce**^[công bố] who would become king.

17.800000	22.040000		Two of the **princes**^[hoàng tử] **stood waiting**^[đứng và chờ (verb + V-ing: (mô tả hành động song song)] outside the king's room.
22.950000	26.320000		Theseus was the oldest and strongest.
26.570000	29.480000		He thought his father would make him king.
30.130000	33.830000		Pelias, the second son, thought differently.
34.280000	36.660000		He was an **expert**^[chuyên gia] in **fighting**^[chiến đấu].
36.940000	39.500000		He thought the king would choose him.

40.550000	42.100000		“When I'm king,”
42.210000	44.440000		Theseus told Pelias,
44.630000	47.700000		"I'll **let**^[Let + O + V (cho phép, để cho ai làm gì)] you **contribute**^[đóng góp, công hiến] to protect our country.
47.890000	49.650000		You can lead the army."

50.640000	52.830000		Pelias became angry.
53.270000	56.600000		"Father knows I'm **famous** for my fighting skills.
56.610000	58.110000		He'll make me king."

58.440000	60.750000		"You?" Theseus said.
60.910000	62.700000		"He won't choose you!"

63.250000	64.850000		"The kingdom is mine!"
65.070000	66.580000		Pelias **claimed**^[tuyên bố, khẳng định].
66.860000	68.700000		"Father will give it to me
68.810000	71.690000		— or I'll **use force**^[dùng vũ lực] to take it!"

72.590000	76.500000		Theseus made a **sudden**^[xảy ra nhanh chóng mà không báo trước] move to take out his sword.^[Theseus bất ngờ rút kiếm]
76.690000	79.100000		Then Pelias did the same.
80.010000	82.450000		"**Beating**^[đánh bại] me will be a **challenge**,"
82.600000	83.870000		Theseus said.
84.120000	85.460000		"Fight me now.
85.660000	87.810000		The winner gets the kingdom!"

88.480000	90.200000		Pelias agreed.

91.200000	94.380000		King Minos could hear his sons fighting.
94.870000	98.490000		The youngest son, Jason, stood **beside**^[bên cạnh] him.
98.880000	101.650000		He **sensed**^[cảm nhận] his father's **sadness**^[nỗi buồn].
102.070000	105.290000		The king **laid**^[lay: đặt (tay)] his hand on Jason's arm.

106.360000	109.280000		"Your brothers fight too much,"
109.580000	111.150000		the king told him.
111.730000	115.410000		"I must **protect** my kingdom from all **harm**^[tổn hại].
116.020000	118.270000		They'll **divide**^[phân chia] it between them.
118.860000	121.590000		The people won't know what to do.
122.030000	123.690000		There'll be war.
123.950000	127.400000		I can't **allow** either of them to be king.
128.210000	129.340000		**Therefore**,
129.670000	131.820000		I'm making you king.
132.430000	136.170000		Your kindness has always made you special.
136.650000	140.390000		It's the **difference** between you and your brothers.
140.980000	143.060000		You can bring **peace**.
143.450000	144.880000		They can't."

145.980000	148.030000		Then the king died.
148.860000	153.870000		Theseus and Pelias heard that their youngest brother was king.
154.810000	156.510000		They were surprised.
156.920000	159.960000		They **realized**^[nhận ra] that their fighting was wrong.
160.440000	163.930000		It had **kept them from**^[ngăn ai đó làm gì] saying goodbye to their father.
164.640000	168.000000		They agreed to have Jason as their king.
168.550000	170.790000		He was the best choice.
