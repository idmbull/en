3.940000	7.000000		Joe made the world a better place.
7.270000	10.450000		He got the idea to do that at school.
10.780000	12.710000		He watched a video there.
12.950000	14.760000		It was about a factory.
15.030000	19.880000		This **factory**^[A factory is a building where things are made or put together.] **produced**^[To produce something is to make or grow it.] a lot of **trash**^[Trash is waste material or unwanted or worthless things.] and put it in a river.
20.250000	23.440000		The trash and water were a bad **mix**^[A mix is different things put together.].
23.710000	28.270000		People **populated**^[If people populate an area, they live there.] the area by the river and drank its water.
29.000000	30.740000		This made them sick.
31.200000	33.400000		Many of them needed **medicine**^[Medicine is something you take to feel better or treat an illness.]
33.390000	36.110000		and made **regular**^[If something is regular, it happens often and in equal amounts of time.] visits to doctors.

36.860000	39.940000		But the video wasn't all bad news.
40.060000	42.610000		It showed ways to pick up trash
42.580000	45.110000		and why it's important to do this.
45.510000	49.180000		It said people can make a difference to their **environment**^[The environment is the place where people work or live.].
49.600000	52.020000		The video's important **features**^[A feature is an important part of something.]
51.930000	55.900000		made Joe **associate**^[Trash is waste material or unwanted or worthless things.] trash with hurting people.

56.920000	59.980000		One day, Joe walked through a park.
60.280000	63.820000		He **recognized**^[To recognize something is to know it because you have seen it before.] some of the problems from the video.
64.260000	68.480000		One **instance**^[An instance is an example of something.] of these problems was the trash in the pond.
68.660000	71.210000		It was full of plastic cups.
71.610000	73.940000		There was too much trash.
74.280000	76.900000		Joe didn't want it to hurt anyone.

77.800000	80.690000		He told his grandfather about the park.
80.870000	82.510000		His grandfather said,
82.700000	86.660000		"You know, it's a **tradition**^[A tradition is something people have been doing for a long time.] in our family to help people.
86.770000	89.640000		That's why we give food to poor people.
89.840000	93.760000		Maybe you can help people by cleaning the park."

94.840000	98.290000		Cleaning the park would **involve**^[To involve means to include as an active participant.] hard work.
98.590000	102.200000		Joe decided to **organize**^[To organize is to plan or get ready for an event.] a group to help him.
103.150000	105.990000		He chose a **wide**^[If something is wide, it is large from side to side.] area of the park.
106.160000	108.100000		It had the most trash.
108.360000	111.010000		He asked his family and friends to come.
111.350000	112.640000		On Saturday,
112.610000	115.160000		he gave everyone a sharp stick.
115.470000	116.940000		They wondered why.
117.250000	118.210000		He said,
118.510000	121.740000		"You use the stick's **tip**^[A tip is a pointed end of something.] to pick up trash.
121.720000	123.300000		This makes it easier.
124.110000	126.580000		They worked for six weeks.
126.700000	129.240000		Different people helped each time,
129.300000	131.970000		but Joe was always there.

133.100000	135.110000		In that **period**^[A period is an amount of time when something happens.] of time,
135.120000	137.790000		Joe saw a **range**^[A range is a number or a set of similar things.] of results.
138.590000	141.100000		There was no trash in the water.
141.300000	143.390000		People could swim in it.
143.770000	146.690000		Joe knew that was a good **sign**^[A sign is an indication giving information, directions, a warning, etc.].
146.970000	148.240000		He was happy
148.190000	150.810000		because he helped his environment.
