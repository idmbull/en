5.000000	9.060000		**Strange**^[A strange thing is unusual or surprising.] and unusual jobs are usually not popular.
9.140000	16.590000		However, they pay well and may be a good option for people who want to do something fun and exciting for work.
16.930000	20.580000		Here are a **few**^[A few things is a small number of them.] strange and unusual jobs.

32.260000	35.380000		It can take years to train for this job.
35.520000	37.800000		This is not an office job,
37.780000	41.650000		as tea samplers travel around the world throughout the year.

42.340000	47.640000		Another unusual but well-paying job is a professional **line**^[A line is a row of people or things.] stander.
47.890000	52.190000		For this job, a person **stands**^[To stand is to use the legs and feet to hold the body upright.] in line for another person.
52.580000	57.700000		Professional line standers are usually **very**^[Very is used to emphasize an adjective or adverb.] busy during big sales
57.660000	59.630000		such as Black Friday
59.620000	62.560000		or the day a new smartphone comes out.
62.850000	64.500000		During these sales,
64.410000	67.510000		line standers can earn quite a lot of money.
67.890000	69.060000		For example,
69.140000	75.640000		one professional line stander **waited**^[To wait is to stay in a place until an expected event happens.] in line for an iPhone 5 for 100 hours
75.590000	78.570000		and earned $1,500.

79.280000	86.030000		**Pet**^[A pet is an animal such as a cat or dog that people keep and care for.] food **companies**^[A company is a business or organization that makes or sells goods or services.] hire pet food tasters to **test**^[To test is to examine something to see if its quality is good.] the taste and quality of their **products**^[A product is something grown or made in a factory in order to be sold.].
86.450000	91.250000		Pet food tasters normally taste dog food or cat food.
91.640000	93.450000		After tasting the food,
93.430000	95.590000		they usually **spit it out**^[nhổ nó ra].
95.840000	99.030000		They need to know which products **sell**^[To sell is to give something to someone in exchange for money.] the best,
98.960000	103.310000		so they read and write many reports about pet food quality.

104.100000	107.900000		Another unusual job is a golf **ball**^[A ball is a round object that is thrown, kicked, or hit in a game or sport.] diver.
108.160000	114.960000		Golf ball divers are **responsible**^[A responsible person is in charge of someone or something.] for **collecting**^[nhặt] golf balls that people have hit into ponds.
115.400000	118.680000		This job is not as easy as it sounds.
118.960000	123.180000		The divers wear **wetsuits**^[đồ lặn] to dive to the **bottom**^[The bottom is the lowest part, point, or level of something.] of a pond,
123.170000	126.250000		which is usually very dirty and dark.
126.690000	129.400000		This job can also be dangerous,
129.390000	132.810000		because sometimes there are **snakes**^[A snake is an animal with a long, thin body and no legs.] in the ponds.
133.210000	137.990000		There have also been cases of divers being bitten by **alligators**^[cá sấu].

138.750000	141.810000		If you're looking for a job **out of the ordinary**^[khác thường],
141.830000	144.250000		figure out what your interest is
144.200000	147.740000		and consider a strange or unusual job.
147.860000	150.030000		You may have to wait for one,
149.980000	152.070000		but it will be worth it!
