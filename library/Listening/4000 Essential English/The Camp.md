3.540000	7.950000		Stacie wanted to stay at a nice hotel for vacation.
8.160000	12.390000		But her parents sent her to a terrible camp instead.
12.970000	14.130000		For breakfast,
14.170000	17.760000		Stacie liked fresh juice and chocolate milk,
17.850000	20.360000		but she got water at the camp.
20.810000	22.090000		In the afternoon,
22.120000	24.240000		she wanted to write **poems**^[A poem is a short kind of writing.],
24.250000	26.380000		but she had to **swim**^[To swim is to move through water.].
26.810000	30.860000		The camp was near an airport with loud planes.
31.140000	34.080000		Spider **webs**^[A web is a home made by a spider.] hung over her bed.
34.390000	38.840000		To her, the kids' **average**^[If something is average, it is at a normal level.] **behavior**^[Your behavior is the way you act.] was very bad.
39.170000	41.960000		No girl **matched**^[To match is to be the same or similar.] her **personality**^[Your personality is what you are like and how you behave.].
42.110000	43.580000		She hated it.

44.710000	46.890000		One day, they had a class.
47.130000	50.520000		**Mental**^[If something is mental, it has to do with your mind.] exercise **sounded**^[To sound means to make a noise.] good to Stacie.
50.830000	53.550000		But it was a **course**^[A course is a class in school.] on water **safety**^[Safety means the condition of being safe and free from danger.].
53.940000	57.250000		They learned how to be safe **passengers**^[A passenger is a person who rides in a car, train, or airplane.] on a boat.
57.780000	61.260000		Stacie didn't ever plan to go on a boat.

62.310000	64.540000		The next day, they played a game.
65.030000	67.760000		There was a red team and a blue team.
68.110000	70.220000		Stacie was on the blue team.
70.580000	75.620000		Each team had to try to **remove**^[To remove something is to take it away.] the other team's flag from a **pole**^[A pole is a long thin stick made of wood or metal that supports things.].
76.160000	78.800000		They also had to use water guns.
79.630000	81.920000		"I'm not much of an **athlete**^[An athlete is a person who plays sports.],"
81.980000	83.070000		she said.
83.260000	85.450000		But she still had to play.

86.190000	90.280000		Stacie took a water gun and looked for somewhere to hide.
90.710000	91.940000		A boy said,
92.070000	93.120000		"Stacie,
93.100000	94.710000		you **advance**^[To advance is to go forward.] to the middle.
94.740000	96.050000		I will go right.
96.140000	98.040000		Those two will go left."

99.060000	102.020000		Stacie still didn't want to play.
102.240000	106.710000		She walked into the forest and saw a red team player coming.
107.460000	109.840000		Stacie hid **behind**^[Behind means to be at the back of something.] a tree
109.790000	112.650000		and then jumped out and **shot**^[To shoot is to fire something like a bullet at someone or something.] the other player.
113.120000	114.730000		“This is fun!"
114.920000	116.320000		Stacie thought.

117.090000	119.960000		Several minutes after moving **further**^[so sánh của far],
119.990000	122.480000		Stacie saw the red flag.
122.590000	125.620000		A red team **member**^[A member is a person who is part of a group.] was **watching over**^[trông chừng, canh gác] it.
125.820000	128.050000		She shot him with her water gun.
128.270000	132.610000		Then she **lowered**^[To lower something is to make it go down.] the flag and ran back to her team.
132.780000	134.140000		"I got it!"
134.280000	135.410000		she said.
135.870000	137.700000		The blue team won!
137.800000	139.990000		Stacie was the hero.

141.040000	142.730000		**For**^[trong suốt (một khoảng thời gian)] **the rest of**^[phần còn lại của] the week,
142.680000	144.560000		Stacie had fun.
144.780000	147.290000		She even made new friends.
