3.800000	7.170000		James Fry was a **fantastic**^[good → great → fantastic] doctor.
7.590000	12.170000		His **surgery**^[phẫu thuật] helped many **disabled people**^[người tàn tật] **overcome**^[vượt qua] their problems.
12.600000	15.780000		He also wrote for a popular doctors' **journal**^[tạp chí học thuật].
16.290000	18.170000		James was very busy.
18.420000	20.020000		His son, Steve,
19.950000	21.340000		**rarely**^[hiếm khi (never → rarely → sometimes)] saw him.

22.050000	26.590000		One day, James was walking and **inspecting**^[To inspect is to look at something carefully.] a patient's file.
26.910000	29.510000		There was water **all over**^[khắp] the floor.
29.750000	32.600000		James slipped on the liquid and fell.
32.940000	35.710000		He fell on a broken **glass tube**^[ống thủy tinh].
35.960000	37.090000		He was hurt.

37.700000	40.490000		Steve came to visit him in the hospital.
40.910000	42.110000		James said,
42.390000	45.130000		“It will be **tough**^[A tough thing is difficult.] for me to stay in bed.
45.460000	47.960000		But I can hardly bend my legs."

48.950000	51.030000		"Then let's watch a movie,"
51.180000	52.360000		Steve said.
52.550000	54.560000		It made them laugh together.
54.850000	55.980000		Steve said,
56.430000	57.880000		“I have to leave,
57.800000	59.890000		but here's some fiction to read."

60.860000	64.290000		James started to **recall**^[To recall something is to remember it.] fun parts of life.
64.670000	67.830000		He **marveled**^[To marvel at something is to feel surprise and interest in it.] at small things, like food.
68.110000	70.700000		He was too busy to notice them before.
71.250000	73.170000		“Steve” he said,
73.490000	76.800000		“you get more food value when you **chew slowly**^[nhai chậm].
77.370000	80.400000		But I think it makes food taste better, too!"

81.590000	83.880000		Weeks later, James said,
84.200000	87.570000		"Steve, I haven't spent enough time with you.
87.940000	89.270000		I **regret**^[hối tiếc (To regret something is to wish that it hadn't happened.)] this.
89.500000	92.700000		Even my **soul**^[tâm hồn, tâm trí] feels better when you visit.
93.160000	95.550000		But I have spent **sufficient**^[Sufficient shows that something is enough, in quality or quantity.] time here.
95.780000	97.290000		We should go home."

98.370000	99.410000		Outside,
99.380000	101.130000		there was a **warm breeze**^[làn gió (nhẹ) ấm áp].
101.270000	103.650000		James watched a **flag blow**^[lá cờ tung bay].

104.280000	105.960000		Finally, James said,
106.590000	108.900000		"I'm still not ready to work.
109.440000	111.620000		I'm going to take a long bath.
111.950000	114.130000		And then we'll watch a movie together.
114.510000	116.200000		I'll start work tomorrow,
116.480000	117.460000		and **this time**^[lần này]
117.640000	119.630000		I will not work too hard."
