4.520000	5.980000		Many years ago,
5.890000	8.560000		a Spanish **officer**^[sĩ quan] named Coronado
8.590000	11.190000		heard the story of seven great cities.
11.830000	14.900000		"The walls of these cities are made of gold,"
14.810000	16.240000		his friends told him.
16.560000	19.460000		"The people eat **meat**^[Meat is food made of animals.] from **golden plates**^[đĩa bằng vàng]
19.420000	21.570000		and dress in nice clothes,"
21.560000	22.550000		they said.
23.030000	26.675074		They called these cities the Seven Cities of Gold.
27.110000	28.700000		Were the cities **real**^[If something is real, it actually exists.]?
29.030000	32.070000		Coronado never **considered**^[To consider something means to think about it.] asking his friends.

33.040000	34.880000		Coronado thought to himself,
35.390000	38.970000		"The things in these cities **must be**^[hẳn là] **worth**^[If something is worth an amount of money, it costs that amount.] a lot of money."
39.360000	42.600000		So he went to find the Seven Cities of Gold.
43.030000	45.240000		He took along three hundred men,
45.270000	47.890000		many horses, and **extra**^[If something is extra, it is more than what is needed.] food.
48.230000	49.620000		They headed west.
49.980000	53.930000		Coronado wanted to **achieve**^[To achieve something is to successfully do it after trying hard.] his **goal**^[A goal is something you work toward.] **very badly**^[nhấn mạnh mức độ mong muốn, không mang nghĩa “xấu”].

54.940000	58.400000		Coronado and his men rode for many days.
58.640000	60.820000		Then they saw some cities.
61.500000	64.180000		"We found the Seven Cities of Gold!"
64.220000	65.500000		his men said,
65.820000	68.270000		but Coronado wasn't happy.
68.510000	70.440000		He had a different **opinion**^[An opinion is a thought about a person or a thing.].
71.130000	74.200000		"These can't be the Seven Cities of Gold,"
74.160000	75.030000		he said.
75.240000	77.400000		"Look, they're made of dirt!"

78.120000	79.750000		Coronado was right.
79.960000	82.620000		The cities weren't **bright**^[rực rõ, sáng] and golden.
82.800000	85.040000		They were **dirty**^[bẩn thỉu] and brown.
85.380000	88.700000		The people didn't eat meat from golden plates.
88.930000	92.010000		They ate **vegetables**^[A vegetable is a plant used as food.] from regular **bowls**^[bát].
92.360000	95.020000		They wore the most **basic**^[If something is basic, it is very simple or easy.] clothes.
95.300000	97.510000		Coronado **regarded**^[To regard people is to think of them in a certain way.] the cities
97.420000	99.380000		as **ugly**^[xấu xí] places.
99.980000	102.450000		"What happened to the cities of gold?"
102.500000	103.380000		he thought.
103.870000	105.680000		"Did someone **destroy**^[To destroy means to damage something so badly that it cannot be used.] them?
105.980000	107.350000		Was there a **war**^[A war is a big fight between two groups of people.]?
107.720000	111.000000		Did someone **already**^[If something happens already, it happens before a certain time.] come and take the gold?"

111.920000	116.360000		That night, the people of the cities **entertained**^[To entertain someone is to do something that they enjoy.] Coronado and his men
116.400000	118.000000		and **served**^[To serve someone is to give them food or drinks.] them food.
118.430000	121.050000		They **advised**^[To advise someone is to tell them what to do.] Coronado to go home.
121.670000	123.610000		"There is no gold here,"
123.590000	124.650000		they told him.
124.980000	126.800000		Coronado was angry.
127.050000	129.440000		Did his friends **lie**^[To lie is to say or write something untrue to deceive someone.] to him?

130.460000	132.100000		He left the next morning.
132.560000	135.340000		He looked back at the cities one more time.
135.660000	139.040000		The sun **reflected**^[To reflect is when a surface sends back light, heat, sound or an image.] light on the dirt houses.
139.430000	142.260000		Coronado thought he saw a **bit**^[A bit is a small amount of something.] of gold.
142.810000	145.230000		Were his friends right after all?
145.750000	147.850000		"No," he told himself.
148.050000	149.740000		"It's just the sun."
150.120000	152.820000		Then he **turned away**^[quay đi] and went home.
