3.840000	8.210000		Last year, I had a **unique**^[A unique person or thing is not like others.] chance to work with my uncle,
8.250000	12.420000		who has **devoted**^[To devote time to something means to spend a lot of time doing it.] his life to studying past **generations**^[A generation is a group of people who live at the same time.].
12.730000	15.850000		I was part of a **crew**^[A crew is a group of workers.] of students he had hired.
16.360000	18.880000		We signed a **contract**^[A contract is a written agreement between two people.] to work with him.
19.060000	20.530000		He was the **boss**^[A boss is a person in charge of other people at work.].
20.850000	23.240000		We lived far from the nearest town,
23.250000	25.590000		and we **dined**^[To dine means to eat dinner.] on what we could find.
25.860000	30.030000		Some of the things we ate had an unusual **flavor**^[A flavor is the taste of food or drinks.].

30.490000	34.380000		We had been there about a month and still hadn't found anything.
34.750000	35.770000		One day,
35.780000	37.950000		I began to **dig**^[To dig is to make a hole in the ground.] in the **soil**^[Soil is the top layer of land on the Earth.].
38.130000	40.330000		The **layers**^[A layer covers over something or is one of several pieces lying on top of each other.] of soil got wetter.
40.430000	43.110000		Soon, I was digging in the **mud**^[Mud is soft, wet dirt.].
43.440000	46.370000		My **shovel**^[cái xẻng] began to get very heavy.
46.730000	52.530000		It felt like it had **doubled**^[Double means twice as much or twice as many.] in weight because the ground had **absorbed**^[To absorb a liquid means to take it inside.] such a lot of water.

53.360000	54.270000		Finally,
54.380000	56.280000		I saw something in the mud.
56.550000	58.300000		It was an old knife!
58.990000	61.740000		The **handle**^[A handle is the part of an object people hold while using it.] felt **smooth**^[A smooth thing has no bumps or rough parts.] in my hand.
61.940000	64.770000		I lifted it up so I could see it better.
65.040000	66.630000		There was writing on it.

67.650000	69.840000		It says "it will bring good luck,"
70.080000	72.150000		my uncle said with a smile.

72.600000	75.720000		The next day, we found many more things.
76.270000	78.400000		There were **pots**^[ấm, bình lọ..] and tools.
78.770000	84.330000		My uncle **donated**^[To donate is to give something to a charity or organization.] all of the things to a special **committee**^[A committee is a group of people who meet together to make decisions.] of a **charitable**^[A charitable organization aims to help people.] **foundation**^[A foundation is a group that provides money for research.].
84.550000	87.510000		Many newspapers wrote stories about it.
87.600000	91.130000		It seemed the knife really did bring good luck!
