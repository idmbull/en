3.820000	7.430000		Matthew was an **adolescent**^[thanh thiếu niên] and a **sensible**^[A sensible person or thing is good and smart.] boy.
7.830000	10.220000		He always kept his room tidy
10.240000	13.210000		and had a natural **literary**^[văn chương] **aptitude**^[năng khiếu].
13.730000	17.020000		He hoped to one day have a career in journalism.
17.440000	19.750000		He spent much of his time reading
19.740000	21.700000		and liked his **privacy**^[sự riêng tư].
21.940000	24.150000		But his quiet personality
24.110000	26.780000		**hindered**^[cản trở] his ability to make friends.

27.450000	32.670000		One day, Matthew went to the pharmacy to **pick up**^[mua (nhặt lên và trả tiền)] some pills for his grandmother.
33.010000	36.600000		He saw some boys leaning against a tree outside.
37.060000	39.730000		One of the boys **complimented**^[khen ngợi] Matthew:
40.330000	41.910000		"I like your jacket."

42.530000	44.030000		Another boy asked,
44.270000	46.900000		"Do you want to go to Nate's Restaurant?"
47.490000	49.650000		"Sure!" Matthew said.
49.960000	52.210000		The boys walked to the restaurant.
52.520000	55.180000		They were going to have **slices**^[lát, miếng] of pizza.
55.590000	57.180000		They ordered their food
57.140000	59.460000		and drank soda with **straws**^[ống hút].
59.730000	62.770000		They ate until their **bellies**^[cái bụng] **swelled**^[To swell is to become larger and rounder.] up.
63.020000	65.710000		Matthew was having so much fun.

66.330000	67.860000		One of the boys said,
68.150000	70.230000		“Let's leave without paying.”
70.770000	72.620000		Matthew didn't want to.
72.910000	77.410000		But he **presumed**^[guess → assume → presume (giả định có cơ sở)] his new friends wouldn't like him if he didn't.

77.810000	80.210000		Suddenly, the waiter yelled,
80.190000	81.040000		“Stop!”
81.400000	83.440000		The two other boys ran,
83.480000	85.460000		leaving Matthew there alone.

85.730000	87.920000		Soon, the police arrived.
88.500000	91.000000		“Leaving without paying for your meal
90.990000	92.980000		is the same as stealing,"
93.090000	94.790000		said the police officer.
95.210000	97.420000		"The restaurant wants **justice**^[công bằng, công lý].
97.660000	100.630000		So next week you have to go to court
100.610000	103.520000		and let a **jury**^[bồi thẩm đoàn] decide your punishment."
104.190000	105.670000		When he went to court,
105.750000	107.020000		the judge asked,
107.290000	109.940000		"Do you have anything to say, Matthew?"
110.600000	111.550000		He said,
111.790000	114.620000		"I am full of **sorrow**^[Sorrow is a very sad feeling.] for what I've done.
114.770000	120.000000		Now I know that real friends won't ask you to do something **illegal**^[bất hợp pháp, trái pháp luật].”
120.760000	123.450000		The jury then let him have his **liberty**^[tự do (trong luật pháp)].
123.680000	127.340000		But they made Matthew pick up garbage as a punishment.
127.770000	129.770000		Much to Matthew's surprise,
129.810000	132.520000		he ended up meeting some new friends.
