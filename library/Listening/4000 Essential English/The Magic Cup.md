3.790000	5.680000		Paul and John were brothers.
6.000000	11.640000		They fought all the time because they both wanted to be leaders of the **agency**^[cơ quan] they both worked at.

12.610000	16.100000		There was a **superstition**^[A superstition is something magical that people believe is real.] in their town about a magic cup.
16.630000	20.230000		People said the cup was in a volcano located far away.
20.970000	24.630000		Anyone who **retrieved**^[Lấy lại cái gì đã mất] the cup would have a wish come true.
25.450000	28.150000		John and Paul both wanted to find it.
28.470000	30.900000		Then, they could become the leader.

31.810000	33.910000		They both left to find the cup.
34.540000	35.930000		Before their trip,
35.850000	38.250000		their mother said they should work together.
38.670000	40.560000		They **dismissed**^[gạt đi] that idea.
41.260000	44.430000		Even though their trips **originated**^[bắt nguồn] from the same house,
44.490000	46.540000		each wanted to travel alone.
47.170000	49.620000		They were both **miserable**^[khổ sở] during the trip.
50.120000	53.740000		They had to **navigate**^[điều khiển, điều hướng] small boats across **shallow**^[nông, cạn] rivers
53.660000	55.700000		and climb difficult **slopes**^[sườn dốc].
56.660000	58.850000		Their journey **spanned**^[kéo dài] many days.
59.320000	61.940000		When they finally got close to the volcano,
61.910000	63.870000		the ground began to **vibrate**^[rung chuyển],
63.800000	65.740000		and the volcano erupted.
66.510000	70.240000		**Ash**^[tro bụi] filled the sky, and **lava**^[dung nham] covered everything.
71.140000	74.800000		John climbed to the top of a hill to keep from getting burned.
75.510000	77.090000		A few moments later,
77.040000	79.160000		his brother went up the same hill.
79.840000	83.490000		They were **confined**^[kẹt] to the hill until the lava cooled down.

84.330000	88.470000		They talked about the things they had seen while **wandering**^[đi lang thang] around the country.
89.170000	93.470000		They felt more **sympathy**^[cảm thông] and **affection**^[Affection is a feeling of liking someone or something.] for each other than ever before.
94.150000	97.250000		They decided that **fate**^[định mệnh] had brought them together.

97.970000	102.090000		The next day, they left to finish the **remainder**^[phần còn lại] of the trip together.
102.670000	104.900000		Everything seemed much easier.
105.510000	107.540000		When they finally found the cup,
107.550000	110.490000		they learned that it didn't make wishes come true.
110.950000	113.310000		It was only an ordinary cup.
114.170000	118.980000		But the trip to reach the cup taught them to work together and love each other.
