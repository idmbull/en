3.280000	6.080000		Cody's family moved to a new house.
6.420000	9.210000		His dad got a new job as a **professor**^[A professor is a person who teaches in college.].
10.200000	12.040000		Cody liked his new town,
12.330000	14.490000		but he missed his grandparents.
14.950000	16.160000		For his birthday,
16.350000	18.450000		Cody wanted to have a party.
18.990000	20.140000		His dad said,
20.370000	23.510000		"Yes, we could even have a band play!"

24.840000	29.240000		On the day of the party, Cody woke up and **rushed**^[To rush is to go somewhere or do something very quickly.] to get ready.
29.740000	32.820000		He started to check his **list**^[A list is a record of information printed with an item on each line.] of things to do.
33.230000	34.940000		He was so excited!
35.500000	38.200000		But then he **noticed**^[To notice something is to see it for the first time.] something terrible.
38.660000	41.760000		There was snow on the ground and lots of it!
42.650000	44.300000		"Dad!" he said.
44.610000	47.860000		"How can the **band**^[A band is a group of people who play music.] play their **instruments**^[An instrument is something designed to do a certain task like play music.] outside?"

48.590000	49.590000		Dad said,
49.930000	52.090000		"We'll move the **stage**^[A stage is a place where actors or musicians act or sing.] inside."
53.010000	58.340000		It **barely**^[Barely means by the smallest amount, almost not.] fit **within**^[You use within to say that something is inside another thing.] the garage because there were some boxes and **garbage**^[Garbage is waste material like unwanted or spoiled food, bottles, paper, etc.] there.
58.850000	60.400000		But when they finished,
60.540000	62.570000		they got a call from the band.
62.940000	65.670000		They did not want to come in the **storm**^[A storm is very bad weather. There is a lot of rain or snow.].
66.350000	67.390000		Dad said,
67.770000	70.050000		"Let's get someone to perform **magic**^[magic]."
70.780000	73.590000		But no one would come because of the snow.

74.580000	76.070000		Finally, Dad said,
76.570000	79.110000		"Cody, there's too much snow.
79.390000	81.420000		We need to **cancel** the party.”

82.380000	83.290000		"Yes, sir,"
83.510000	85.080000		Cody said sadly.
85.560000	88.160000		"It's going to be a **boring**^[If something is boring, it is not fun.] birthday,"
88.220000	89.150000		he **predicted**^[To predict something is to say that it will happen.].
89.850000	92.750000		Cody wanted to **share**^[To share something is to give some of it to another person.] his birthday with someone.
93.090000	95.460000		He wanted to be at his old home.
95.820000	98.160000		He wanted to see his grandparents.

98.770000	101.120000		But then something got his attention.
101.530000	103.770000		He noticed a car in the **driveway**^[A driveway is a short private road that leads to a person's home.].
104.320000	107.060000		His grandparents **owned**^[To own something means to have it. That thing belongs to you.] a car like that!

107.830000	109.070000		Cody was right.
109.390000	112.130000		His grandparents came for his birthday!
112.670000	114.400000		"Happy birthday, Cody!
114.630000	116.370000		We're sorry we are late.
116.640000	118.663776		But there was so much snow.
118.584816	120.490000		It made us **go off**^[bắt đầu có phản ứng / thay đổi trạng thái] **schedule**^[A schedule is a plan that tells you when to do things.].
120.914138	123.404138		We tried to leave a **message**^[A message is a set of words that you send to someone.] to tell you."

124.260000	126.090000		Cody told them what happened.
126.500000	127.610000		"I'm sorry,"
127.860000	129.040000		said Grandpa.

129.780000	130.910000		"I was sad,"
131.120000	132.080000		Cody said.
132.590000	134.040000		“But I'm not anymore.
134.250000	136.260000		I'm so happy to see you."
137.200000	140.590000		Dad brought out something special for Cody's birthday.
140.980000	142.410000		It was his favorite,
142.660000	145.250000		a sundae with whipped cream on top.
145.750000	149.240000		Then Cody told his grandparents about the new town.
149.670000	152.050000		It was his best birthday ever.
