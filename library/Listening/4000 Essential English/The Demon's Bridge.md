4.300000	8.642813		A young woman's cow had crossed the river in the morning
8.541372	11.190000		when the water level was **moderate**^[When something is moderate, it is not too big or too small in size or amount.].
11.680000	15.990000		But when the woman returned with her dog to get the cow,
16.080000	20.260000		she was **overwhelmed**^[To overwhelm is to exist in such a large amount that someone cannot deal with it.] by how high the water **had risen**^[dâng lên].
20.930000	22.830000		Even if she crossed,
22.820000	26.890000		she still couldn't **lead**^[When you lead something, you go first and it follows you.] her cow back through the river.

27.920000	30.050000		"What am I going to do?"
30.440000	31.780000		she wondered.

32.230000	33.350000		Suddenly,
33.420000	36.020000		a man appeared across the river.
37.070000	43.760000		"A **fragile**^[When people or things are fragile, they are not strong and can be damaged easily.] young lady like you shouldn't have to work so hard to get across a river,"
44.110000	45.100000		he said.
45.540000	47.950000		"I'll build you a bridge."

48.800000	53.310000		The man was not the **usual**^[When something is usual, it is what we expect.] kind of person she met.
53.630000	56.360000		The young woman's **perception**^[A perception of a situation is a way of thinking about it or understanding it.] of him
56.360000	58.840000		was that he was a **sociable**^[When someone is sociable, they are friendly.] person.
59.780000	61.240000		He was **talkative**^[When someone is talkative, he or she talks a lot.],
61.190000	63.740000		**yet**^[tuy nhiên] something was strange about him.
63.970000	67.540000		But her **innocence**^[sự ngây thơ, trong sáng] allowed her to trust the man.

68.840000	72.170000		"I don't want to be a **burden**^[A burden is a serious or difficult responsibility.] to you, sir,"
72.890000	74.520000		the woman replied.

75.390000	76.740000		"Don't worry,"
77.080000	80.980000		he told her as he began **crafting**^[To craft something is to make it using skill.] a bridge.
82.460000	87.580000		He **merged**^[To merge two things is to combine them into one whole thing.] the pieces of the bridge together with amazing **speed**^[When you speed, you go very fast.].
87.660000	89.900000		Soon, it was finished.

90.970000	95.340000		"Oh, but how can I give you money for your work?
95.580000	97.250000		Let's **compromise**^[To compromise is to agree to something that is not exactly what you want.].
97.410000	100.940000		I am sure that we can find a fair solution.
101.360000	102.850000		What do you think?"
103.340000	104.860000		the woman asked.

106.040000	111.180000		"The only **payment**^[When you make a payment, you give someone some money for what you get.] I need is the first living thing that crosses the bridge,"
111.550000	113.150000		the man replied.

114.630000	115.870000		She thought,
116.470000	119.400000		"This deal sounds strange.
119.880000	123.420000		Maybe he's actually a river **demon**^[quỷ dữ]."
123.940000	129.180000		She **shivered**^[A shiver is a shaking movement the body makes when someone is cold or scared.] because she realized that he **had taken advantage of**^[đã lợi dụng] her
129.150000	131.540000		and **settled**^[When you settle something, you reach an agreement.] the deal somehow.
132.220000	134.630000		But she had a plan of her own.
135.100000	138.330000		She pulled a piece of bread from her pocket
138.300000	140.950000		and threw it across the bridge.
141.320000	143.570000		Her dog ran after it.

144.460000	148.750000		"The dog is the first living thing across the bridge,"
149.260000	151.110000		she said to the man.

152.220000	154.340000		The man was angry.
154.730000	159.590000		He suddenly changed into a half-human and half-fish.
160.210000	162.460000		"What's the matter with you!”
162.750000	164.000000		he shouted.
164.370000	165.900000		“You tricked me.
165.840000	169.100000		I have no use for your dog!”
169.390000	173.130000		he **screamed**^[gào lên] and **dived**^[When you dive into water, you go down head first into the water.] into the river.

173.920000	178.460000		The woman sped across the bridge to the other side
178.400000	182.160000		and had a happy **meeting**^[When you have a meeting, you are with other people.] with her dog and cow.
