5.060000	6.360000		Dear Diary,

7.100000	9.090000		I am beyond excited!
9.260000	13.320000		My **cousin**^[anh chị em họ] Ella is coming **all the way**^[nhấn mạnh rằng một khoảng cách là rất xa xôi, hoặc ai đó đã phải bỏ ra rất nhiều công sức để di chuyển/làm việc gì đó.] from England for a visit.
13.700000	16.210000		We haven't seen each other for many years.
16.740000	18.620000		Ella's plane will land^[hạ cánh] soon,
18.600000	20.820000		and I want to be a **gracious host**^[chủ nhà chu đáo]
20.730000	24.500000		and get everything ready to welcome my special guest from abroad.

25.250000	28.250000		The warm temperature in **July**^[tháng bảy] is just right.
28.800000	30.110000		Earlier today,
30.070000	33.840000		I opened the window to let in fresh air and looked outside.
34.460000	37.180000		The afternoon sky was a brilliant blue,
37.270000	39.730000		the grass was a fresh **emerald**^[ngọc bích, ngọc lục bảo] green,
39.750000	42.400000		and the pink roses were in full bloom.
43.210000	45.880000		It was a **stunning display**^[khung cảnh tuyệt đẹp, choáng ngợp] of natural beauty.
46.370000	48.950000		Ella is coming at the perfect time!

50.160000	53.800000		I still have to finish cleaning up and then vacuum the **carpet**^[tấm thảm].
54.470000	58.460000		I have already stocked the refrigerator with Ella's favorite foods.
58.980000	60.060000		Last night,
60.020000	61.780000		I set out clean towels
61.720000	64.160000		and arranged the guest bedroom for Ella.
64.790000	68.110000		I will set out toiletries and other things soon.

69.030000	73.590000		I want to **go over**^[xem lại, kiểm tra kỹ] the activity list for Ella's visit one last time.
74.270000	79.390000		I made sure to keep a copy of the list on my **desk** and also on my computer.
80.630000	83.750000		I **meticulously planned**^[lên kế hoạch tỷ mỹ, kỹ lượng] the details for each day
83.700000	87.610000		so that they are **productive**^[hiệu quả, có ích] and packed with fun-filled activities.

88.920000	91.100000		I know that Ella loves history,
91.060000	93.610000		so we will visit the museum on Monday,
93.590000	97.410000		where there is a special show about architecture in modern cities.
98.530000	101.390000		We will go to the art gallery on Tuesday
101.360000	104.280000		and see the latest works of **contemporary art**^[nghệ thuật đương đại].
105.230000	108.570000		I also want to take Ella to the upper part of town
108.620000	111.600000		because that is where the best shopping and sales are.
112.170000	114.420000		Then, we'll watch Hamlet,
114.390000	118.210000		a Shakespearean play being performed at the local drama theater.

119.080000	124.220000		I also want to take Ella on a **canoe** ride and enjoy the many lakes around the city.
124.840000	126.870000		We can pack a picnic basket,
126.840000	128.330000		have lunch at the lake,
128.320000	130.740000		and enjoy the beautiful weather outside.
131.510000	135.660000		I am really excited about it because I've never been on a canoe ride!

136.530000	140.910000		There are so many **sightseeing opportunities**^[cơ hội tham quan] and so much to show Ella,
141.010000	143.620000		but I also want to spend time at home with Ella
143.530000	145.960000		so we can both relax and **catch up**^[hàn huyên, tâm sự (đuổi kịp những thông tin đã bỏ lỡ của nhau)].

146.860000	151.070000		I'd better run because it's almost time to pick up Ella at the airport.

151.420000	153.240000		I can't wait to see Ella!

154.080000	155.590000		Love, Gemma
