4.260000	7.910000		One day, Sam walked to his uncle's ice cream shop.
8.520000	11.180000		When he reached the sidewalk near the shop,
11.240000	13.820000		he **caught the scent**^[Ngửi thấy thoang thoảng] of ice cream cones
13.850000	16.980000		and **anticipated**^[expect (mong đợi với sự sẵn sàng)] eating some ice cream.

17.290000	19.050000		Sam opened the door.
19.230000	22.360000		Uncle John had a new, steel machine.
22.790000	24.000000		"What is that?"

24.690000	26.110000		“It's a cone maker.
26.310000	28.040000		I built it from a kit.
28.400000	30.670000		You take flour from the **barrel**^[thùng]
30.640000	32.670000		and put it in this **pan**^[khay],"
32.930000	34.390000		Uncle John said.
34.640000	37.780000		"Then, add water and sugar here
37.760000	40.470000		and stir it so the sugar **dissolves**^[hòa tan].
40.710000	43.650000		Next, you **fasten**^[đóng chặt] down the **beam**^[A beam is a heavy bar.]."
44.290000	46.840000		Uncle John wanted to look casual,
46.900000	48.600000		but he was excited.
48.760000	52.370000		He made a few **swift**^[A swift person or animal is fast.] movements and turned it on.
52.630000	54.460000		There was a **puff of smoke**^[luồng khói],
54.600000	57.480000		and then cones came out the other end.

58.210000	60.010000		"Is it hard to use?"
60.070000	61.160000		Sam asked.

61.560000	63.090000		"On the **contrary**^[A contrary thing is the opposite to another thing.],
63.120000	64.920000		it's easy to use.
64.980000	66.210000		Want to try?"

66.820000	69.370000		Sam washed his hands with **caution**^[cẩn thận].
69.610000	73.730000		He made a **deliberate**^[có chủ đích] attempt to keep **germs**^[vi khuẩn] out of the **dough**^[bột nhào].
73.990000	76.950000		Soon, Sam had his first cone.
77.080000	79.000000		He smiled in **triumph**^[Triumph is the act or feeling of winning.]!

79.660000	82.520000		Uncle John tried to turn the machine off,
82.760000	85.010000		but it kept making cones.
85.350000	88.310000		Sam and Uncle John put them on the **counter**^[quầy hàng],
88.530000	90.160000		then on chairs.
90.320000	91.530000		Before long,
91.510000	94.530000		cones were **scattered**^[vương vãi] all over the floor.

94.800000	97.050000		They tried everything to stop it,
97.120000	98.780000		but it wouldn't stop!
99.610000	101.540000		"What are we going to do?"
101.620000	102.600000		he said.

103.020000	105.230000		"Kick it!" yelled Sam.
105.540000	107.740000		Uncle John lifted his foot
107.730000	110.030000		and gave the machine a kick.
110.390000	112.400000		It made a funny noise
112.360000	113.780000		and **exploded**^[To explode is to suddenly move apart in many smaller pieces.].
114.090000	116.670000		They were both covered with dough.
116.970000	120.410000		Uncle John laughed when he knew Sam was OK.
120.810000	124.450000		He **tossed**^[To toss something is to throw it softly.] Sam a **rag**^[khăn lau (A rag is a small towel.)] to clean his face and smiled.
124.760000	127.410000		"I guess we have enough cones now!"
