3.710000	7.950000		An **awful**^[An awful thing is very bad.] woman lived with her daughter and stepdaughter in her **household**^[A household is all the people who live in one house.].
8.410000	12.000000		She **possessed**^[To possess something is to have it or own it.] feelings of hate for her stepdaughter, Anna.
12.750000	15.410000		Anna worked while her stepsister did nothing.
16.160000	18.020000		On a cold January night,
18.150000	19.800000		Anna's stepmother **remarked**^[To remark is to say something.],

22.920000	24.280000		Go and find some."

25.310000	28.930000		Anna was **anxious**^[Anxious means feeling worried or nervous.] about walking through the chilly **landscape**^[A landscape is how an area of land looks.].
29.380000	31.980000		The cold air made her **lungs**^[A lung is a part of the body that fills with air when breathing.] burn.
32.430000	35.460000		She walked at a slow **pace**^[The pace of something is the speed at which it happens.] because of the snow.
36.070000	38.540000		Soon, she saw a group of people.
38.900000	40.900000		It **consisted**^[To consist of certain is to be made of parts or things them.] of twelve men.
41.470000	43.640000		Anna told them about the flowers.

44.380000	48.800000		One of the men said they were the twelve months and that they would help Anna.
49.700000	53.130000		January walked to her and made a **motion**^[A motion is a movement that someone makes.] with his hand.
53.730000	57.720000		The days of the month passed **rapidly**^[Rapidly means happening very fast.] until it was February's turn.
58.340000	61.240000		February also made the month speed up.
61.760000	64.080000		Then, March made the sun **shine**^[To shine is to make a bright light.],
64.130000	66.250000		and flowers grew in the field.

67.120000	71.550000		Anna **loaded**^[To load is to put objects into something.] her basket with so many flowers that she could hardly **lift**^[To lift something is to move it higher.] it.
72.150000	74.420000		Then, she gave a quick but **polite**^[Polite shows a thoughtful and kind behavior.]
74.570000	76.820000		"thank you" to the twelve men
76.850000	78.200000		and returned home.
78.900000	82.870000		She was very **eager**^[Eager shows excitement about something.] to show her stepmother all the flowers.
83.400000	84.570000		Back at the house,
84.680000	87.320000		she **spilled**^[To spill is to accidentally make something fall out of its container.] the flowers onto the table.
87.850000	91.460000		Then, she told her stepmother about the twelve men.
92.030000	96.150000		Anna's stepmother and stepsister went to **seek**^[To seek is to look for something.] the twelve months.
96.550000	99.110000		Their **intent**^[An intent is a plan to do something.] was to ask for gifts.
99.500000	100.910000		They looked and looked.
101.230000	104.340000		They became lost and never found their way home,
104.750000	107.330000		so Anna lived happily by herself.
