### Exercise 4

I have absolutely no interest in clothes. When I get dressed in the morning, I usually put on the same clothes that I wore yesterday. It's really cold where I live so I need a warm jacket with pockets to put my money and cellphone in. **Apart from**^[ngoại trừ] that, I really don't care what I wear.

I'm quite interested in clothes. I generally wear jeans and a shirt but I have a lot of shirts. I have one on today that I really like. My girlfriend bought in for me - it's a good colour - light blue. My girlfriend tells me that blue really suits me! It's also quite light which is great when the weather is hot, like it is now.

### Exercies 5

Sara: You look really nice in that dress, Emily. It really suits you.
→ Sara: Emily, bạn trông rất đẹp trong chiếc váy đó. Nó thật sự rất hợp với bạn.

Emily: Thanks. It’s new – I bought it at the weekend. In fact, I bought two dresses.
→ Emily: Cảm ơn nhé. Nó là váy mới – mình mua nó vào cuối tuần. Thật ra mình đã mua hai chiếc váy.

Sara: You’re lucky – dresses look really nice on you. What’s the other one like?
→ Sara: Bạn may mắn thật – váy trông rất đẹp khi bạn mặc. Chiếc còn lại trông thế nào?

Emily: It’s red with a little collar and short sleeves – I’m really pleased with it. There was a gorgeous black dress in the shop that I liked too, but when I put it on, I found that it didn’t fit very well – it was a bit tight.
→ Emily: Nó màu đỏ, có cổ nhỏ và tay ngắn – mình rất hài lòng với nó. Trong cửa hàng cũng có một chiếc váy đen rất đẹp mà mình thích, nhưng khi mặc thử thì mình thấy nó không vừa lắm – hơi chật.

Emily: I also bought a pair of sandals that I’m very pleased with. They’re black with thin straps and high heels.
→ Emily: Mình cũng mua một đôi xăng-đan mà mình rất ưng. Chúng màu đen, có quai mảnh và gót cao.

Sara: Don’t you already have some black sandals?
→ Sara: Chẳng phải bạn đã có vài đôi xăng-đan đen rồi sao?

Emily: I do, but I wanted some more fashionable ones. My other pair look a bit old-fashioned now.
→ Emily: Có chứ, nhưng mình muốn vài đôi thời trang hơn. Đôi còn lại của mình bây giờ trông hơi lỗi mốt.

Sara: You have a lot of clothes, Emily!
→ Sara: Bạn có nhiều quần áo thật đấy, Emily!
