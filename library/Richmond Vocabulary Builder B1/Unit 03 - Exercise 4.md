0.195017	3.655017		I met Adam on my first day at university.
3.985017	6.995017		He helped me carry my bags to my room,
7.115017	9.965017		and we became friends **straight away**^[ngay lập tức; immediately],
10.035017	14.385017		although he's quite a shy person and didn't say much.
15.025017	17.005017		He's always kind to me,
17.055017	18.995017		and now I know him better,
18.955017	21.545017		I know that he has a good sense of humour.
22.215017	24.475017		If I feel **upset**^[buồn, khó chịu, không vui (Dùng cho cảm xúc nhẹ đến trung bình)] about something,
24.655017	26.035017		I always call him.

28.005017	30.245017		I love spending time with Lisa
30.225017	32.155017		because she's **such**^[thực sự (nhấn mạnh)] good fun.
32.725017	34.765017		She's a very lively person,
34.845017	36.435017		really full of energy
36.985017	40.155017		– she loves parties and she never stops talking!
40.915017	43.345017		Our teachers don't like her much though,
43.415017	45.965017		and she can be a bit lazy about work.
46.605017	50.465022		We have a **strict**^[nghiêm khắc] English teacher who gets very angry
50.465022	52.735017		because Lisa never does her homework,
52.905017	54.765017		but it doesn't make any difference!
