0.161225	3.231225		I'm finding it very difficult to make friends here.
4.182294	6.742294		My new **colleagues**^[đồng nghiệp] are really unfriendly
7.262294	9.072294		– **nobody ever**^[không ai… bao giờ (phủ định mạnh)] speaks to me.
10.142294	13.562294		Sometimes I think that I should try to start a conversation,
13.802294	15.092294		but I'm too shy.
16.062294	17.522294		On my first day,
17.502294	18.522294		I was late
18.532294	20.592294		because I didn't know which bus to get.
21.202294	23.042294		My boss shouted at me,
23.302294	25.332294		which I thought was really unkind.
25.872294	27.892294		He's so serious all the time
28.342294	31.342294		– he spends all day checking everyone's work,
31.422294	33.212294		and he never seems to smile.

36.562294	39.182294		I started my new job last week,
39.202294	40.502294		and I'm loving it.
40.992294	43.132294		Everyone has been really helpful,
43.442294	46.902409		showing me what to do and helping me learn the systems.
47.912294	51.372294		One thing I've noticed is how polite everyone is
51.602294	54.972294		– people always speak to each other in a very **pleasant way**^[cách nói chuyện dễ chịu].
55.652294	59.252294		At first, I thought that my colleagues were quite quiet,
59.462294	61.342294		because they don't chat much.
61.802294	64.212294		Then they invited me out one evening,
64.252294	67.253662		and I discovered that when they're not in the office,
67.292294	68.932294		they're much more lively!
